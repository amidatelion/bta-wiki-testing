		"Details": "The One-Shot Thumper Cannon is an integrated but single-use unique artillery piece mounted on the Bull Shark. Unlike a true Thumper, the One-Shot Thumper Cannon fires a specialized shaped charge that deals massive damage to a relatively small area, for artillery that is. The cannon is single use and requires uninterrupted use of the targeting systems, so it cannot be fired with other weapons, but the damage is extreme enough to make it worth the trade off. Still, the technology never reached production and was never widely used.",
