9c0d9ecbfcdf2a31597bf76f"ÀCommander, while I must commend you on your great work. It saddens me to inform you we've learned that Justin Raza was just in his actions. It seems from the information obtained by our security teams at both sites. That Governor Hanover Phist is truly the culprit behind everything. Evidence shows that Phist was renting indebted workers to his men for /"entertainment/" purposes and Commander Raza learned of this and took actions against Phist and his men.*  (:

9c8ced54b618553412827724"ßWhile Raza was able to take down Phist's men. It wasn't in time to stop the governor and his men from killing the civilians to frame his company. Knowing many times it is shoot first, ask question later in these circumstances. Commander Raza retreated to a place he felt he had the means to defend his men while the /"crime/" was investigated. However, his dropship's comms. were damaged so he could not reply to our hails.*  (:

9c0123470ce56163fc87fbfa"‰We were able to recover Commander Raza's body, along with the family of Governor Phist from the rubble of the outpost. It seems they fled with the commander for their own safety. Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}, please know you can take your pay with a clear conscience. As none of us knew of this information when we tasked you this assignment. We all thought you were hunting a monster. I'll have my staff arrange the transfer of payment with your XO. I'm sorry that this happened, Commander. You can rest easy knowing you did your duty, even if it was an unfortunate end for what looks to have been a good man.*  (:
