The Clans wisely maintained and built on this solid frame a real assault 'Mech, the Warhammer IIC. The Warhammer IIC is built on an Endo Steel frame and is protected by twelve tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor. Designed by Clan Diamond Shark, this variant replaces the PPCs and missile launcher of the original design with a pair of arm-mounted Heavy Large Lasers, two additional heat sinks, and a half ton of armor. An advanced Targeting Computer was also added to help ensure that the hard-to-use heavy lasers hit. The brace of Medium Pulse Lasers was retained from the WHM IIC-1.",
