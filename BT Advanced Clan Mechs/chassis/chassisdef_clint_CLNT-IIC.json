		"Details": "When General Kerensky left the Inner Sphere on his Exodus with the SLDF, he took with him many Star League mechs, including the venerable Clint. While the Clint was never a popular mech in the Inner Sphere, the Clans did keep it in production and even upgraded it over the years until reaching this, the Clint IIC. Armed with a Clan-spec LB-10X Autocannon and twin Clan ER Medium Lasers, the Clint IIC is quite dangerous at all ranges. However, the mech is held back by its use of standard heat sinks, leading to large heat buildups unless the pilot is very cautious.",
