		"Details": "In 2832, Clan Mongoose unleashed an upgraded version of the venerable 'Mech on the Clans, known as the Locust IIC. Designed as a fast and light reconnaissance vehicle, the Locust was also tasked with fast-strike raids and at least became a front-line unit in the Inner Sphere. Larger than the original Locust, the IIC gives MechWarriors comparable speed with more protection and terrifying offensive capabilities. This version was almost completely redesigned so that it could be produced in the Inner Sphere by Clan Jade Falcon on their Occupation Zone headquarters world of Sudeten. It replaces the small lasers of the standard variant with three Heavy Small Lasers in each arm. The medium pulse laser has been downgraded to an ER Medium Laser, while a pair of additional double heat sinks are added to help deal with the increased heat.",
