		"Details": "One only needs to take a single glance at Giant to see why he got his callsign. The man is huge. But just as huge is his spirit and joviality. Amongst friends he's known as the Gentle Giant because a smile is always on his face. However, his smile hides a dark past.\r\n\r\nAndre spent the last 15 years in prison. He doesn't talk about why he was jailed but he can sometimes be heard mumbling quietly to himself. Something haunts him and it often leads him to excessive drinking. But still, he is a reliable battlefield tank pilot and gives everything in combat. Perhaps he simply needs someone to give him a second chance. Or someone to get him to kick his drinking habit. Or both.",
