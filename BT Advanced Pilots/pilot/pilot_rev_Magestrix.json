		"Details": "Magestrix used to hate her name. It was an epithet she was teased with endlessly from childhood. Growing up in the Free Worlds League was difficult as an immigrant from the Magistracy of Canopus. It made things worse that her mother kept insisting that they were part of the Centrella family of Canopus. Whether or not she is actually a part of the Centrella family is unknown but her usage of the surname and her mother's insistence of membership led to Celes being mocked as a Magestrix pretender.\r\n\r\nThankfully once her fellow soldiers used the name as a sign of respect, she grew to like it. She became their Magestrix Of Victory in battle after destroying an enemy 'Mech in her first combat operation. Since then, she has been on a winning streak. Some say it's due to luck, others say it's due to her bravery, and others still say it's due to her skill. Regardless of the cause, she has never been on the losing side in a conflict. Unfortunately for Celes, she is starting to naively believe that she may have a divine blessing for victory.",
