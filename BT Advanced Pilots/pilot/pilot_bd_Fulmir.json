		"Details": "Growing up on Sevon provided a young Ermis Sharpe with three important things that would come to define his life going forward. An eduction rich in the tumultuous history of the planet and the Outworlds Alliance as a whole, the chance to meet some of the best and brightest of the Alliance Military from the nearby base, and the opportunity to work with armed Mechs produced by Alliance Motors. Unfortunately all of this also led to being considered 'worldly' with his head in the clouds, so when the opportunity to join a Jumpship Crew arrose he lept at the opportunity. From there he landed with a small Mercenary Company after an argument over historical battle tactics during a jump recharge period led to a Sim Duel. Ermes lost, of course, but he aquitted himself well for someone who'd never piloted so much as a 'Mech sim until that morning, and his tactical theories surprised the Mercenaries.\r\n\n\n Since then he's signed on with various units, lacking the focus or charisma to command, but proving a reliable advisor and frequently finding himself, officially or unofficially, second in command of a Lance. When possible he takes to Heavy or Assault mechs, adopting a second line fire support role where he can stay aware of the Battlefield and provide support where it's needed, and proving a deft hand at coordinating a Lance from a Command Console.",
