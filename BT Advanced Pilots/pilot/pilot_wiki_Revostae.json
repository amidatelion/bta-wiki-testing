		"Details": "A former MechWarrior of the Draconis Combine Mustered Soldiery, Kryl grew up distrusting and disrespecting mercenaries. However, during Operation BULLDOG he encountered a number of mercenaries who proved both skilled and honorable. They also had a degree of freedom on the battlefield that he had always wished for. At the next possible opportunity he decided to leave the DCMS and pursue a mercenary career.\r\n\r\nIn spite of appearance, Kryl's preference and talent for indirect firing missiles was not fostered out of cowardice but due to a healthy respect for the strength of his adversaries. He always believed he needed an absolute advantage to defeat those he considered his betters. One way to do that was to strike and weaken them before they even saw him.\r\n\r\nIronically his constant need to exploit every weakness in his enemy due to feeling inferior led to him gaining a reputation as a capable Mechwarrior. Kryl is willing to work for anyone as long as he can use his tactics and skills freely on the battlefield and reach his peak potential.\r\n\r\n <b><color=#099ff2>SPECIAL AFFINITY WITH ARCHERS</color></b>\r\n\r\n <b><color=#099ff2>CHECK PASSIVE ABILITIES IN COMBAT FOR A UNIQUE SURPRISE</color></b>",
