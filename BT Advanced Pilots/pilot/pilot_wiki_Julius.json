		"Details": "Born in a far flung, barely controlled planet within the Taurian Concordat, Julius' family was perhaps too close to the local pirate syndicate. Sold into debt slavery at the age of seventeen before he could begin his military conscription, Julius' prior experience with ICE Crosscuts proved valuable to the pirates, and found himself in the cockpit of a Rocket Launcher armed Locust where his deft piloting and lack of gunnery skills were most capably applied. The pirate life was not for him, however, and a lucky intercept of a vessel carrying fusion cores and LosTech agricultural computers gave him enough shares of the loot to pay off his debt and put a downpayment on a WVR-3R and went legit! Julius Deane is now scraping by as a mercenary contractor, still looking for another big break and a great opportunity with the right company.",
