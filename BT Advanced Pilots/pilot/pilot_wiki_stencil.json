		"Details": "Thomas learned his trade at the Taurian Ã‰cole Militaire. With a curriculum that emphasized defense in depth, Thomas learned the value of mass artillery positioned on high ground. Thomas served with the 1st Taurian Lancers; first as spotter, later in command of his own maniple of artillery support vehicles.\r\n\r\nHis career was cut short due to his extremely public dissent over the Concordant's alliance with the Capellan Confederation. A number of stencils matching anti-Capellan artworks and slogans spray painted across the capitol were found amongst his possessions. The Campbell clan had nearly been eradicated on Mendham in the early 25th century during the atrocities of the Liao invasion. They lost vast holdings and wealth when the planet fell to House Liao.\r\n\r\nThe Campbell clan, in addition to grudges, hold to the Inheritor creed: the belief that the inner sphere will destroy itself leaving the Periphery states as saviors to restore and rekindle humanity. Having resigned his commission, Thomas left for the inner sphere to do his part to bring that about a little bit sooner. He wishes to \"throw some gasoline on the fires\" of the inner sphere.\r\n\r\nHe believes that every bit of chaos sown, all the destruction and collateral damage done, weakens the Inner Sphere houses and therefore protects the people of the Taurian Concordat from another invasion.",
