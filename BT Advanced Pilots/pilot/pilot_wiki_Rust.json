		"Details": "Drew Erny was not supposed to be a MechWarrior. Originally, he was enrolled in a prestigious Lyran university, soon to move on to a corporation like Coventry Metalworks or Defiance Industries. He was supposed to join the ranks of engineers, expanding technology in a golden age of advancement.\r\n\r\nThose plans were ended when Drew got involved in a protest against some of the planet's ruling nobility. Though his motives were pure and his participation peaceful, the nobility had him expelled from the university, just months from completion, and blacklisted from ever working in Lyran space again.\r\n\r\nWith his future in shambles, he decided to turn his skills in a more practical direction, and signed on with a mercenary command as a MechTech. He quickly rose through the ranks, making a particular name for himself with his talent for resurrecting the most ancient BattleMechs. Here, he earned the nickname \"Rust Developer\" for the iron oxide dust he seemed perpetually coated in.\r\n\r\nNow, no longer content with picking apart mechs with wrenches and torches, he's branching out to lasers, missiles, and autocannons. Rust Dev is pursuing the storybook trope of the MechTech-turned-MechWarrior, and he won't stop until he's got his name in both history books.",
