		"Details": "Tab hails from Erewhon, a sleepy little world located in the former Greater Valkyrate. His family eked out a quiet but prosperous living shipping materials and goods across the planet for their pirate rulers, and Tab spent much of his childhood roaming the wilds of Erewhon, learning to live off the land and becoming a crack shot with his father's old Mauser hunting rifle. At the age of 17, he enlisted in the Erewhon militia and became a competent pilot of the primitive frankenmechs that the Valkyrate used as a deterrents against raids by the neighboring Oberon Confederation. When the Clans smashed into the Valkyrate in 3049, Tab lost his family, his friends, and his home. Barely managing to stow onboard a shuttle and join a refugee flotilla, he signed on with the first mercenary command that would have him. His love of the outdoors never left him however, and these days he spends most of his time outside the cockpit literally outside. Never one for trophy hunting, his dream is to write a cookbook with perfected recipes for every one of the Clan totem animals.\r\n\r\n <b><color=#099ff2>SPECIAL AFFINITY WITH CORSAIRS</color></b>\r\n\r\n <b><color=#099ff2>CHECK PASSIVE ABILITIES IN COMBAT FOR A UNIQUE SURPRISE</color></b>",
