		"Details": "The man known as The Sharmat is a great and enduring mystery. Never seen without his trademark three-eyed golden mask, Dagoth is as mysterious as a pilot can possibly be. He admits to no stated origin, only referencing his home as 'the Sixth House' and saying he was betrayed by those he once called his allies and so was driven out into the cold, cold stars. His skills in the cockpit are excellent and he follows orders without question though there is always a feeling that he is silently judging and making his own secret plans. He has no reputation from other mercenary companies as no one claims to have previously hired him. It is as though he simply appeared in the hiring hall with no history one day. However, if you really ask around, there's rumors that he has some dark sorcery that chases him across the stars and that he is fleeing from. Oh, and don't ask why he names every mech he drives Akulakhan, you won't get an answer.",
