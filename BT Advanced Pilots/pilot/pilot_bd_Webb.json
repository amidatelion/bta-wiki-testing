		"Details": "Not much for certain is known about Webb's past. His mannerisms and fighting style remind observers of the Draconis Combine. And whether it be tales involving mercenary commands, Great House special operations teams or even expeditions to the Deep Periphery, Webb politely deflects all inquiries into his past.\r\n\r\n While as deadly as any in a 'Mech, he is a rare sight in mercenary halls; a mercenary with Battle Armor experience. He will happily speak with those who share his passion for battlesuits, from Technicians to Clan Elementals. In those conversations that range from HarJel to deep-space boarding actions, Webb demonstrates his expertise on Battle Armor.\r\n\r\n Currently, Webb prefers the employ of mercenary commands that not only increase his experience with Battle Armor, but those who also demonstrate a sound business strategy. It is by learning both Webb pursues his own goal of running his own command some day.\r\n\r\n <b><color=#099ff2>SPECIAL AFFINITY WITH KANAZUCHI, RAIDEN, INFILTRATOR, GRENADIER, VOID, AND INNER SPHERE STANDARD BATTLE ARMORS</color></b>",
