		"Callsign": "Zenith",
		"Gender": "Male",
		"Faction": "Davion",
		"Age": "24",
		"Details": "Alexander was supposed to be a teacher or a physician or a politician. Life, unfortunately, conspired to ruin those plans. Growing up on a fringe world close to the border between Davion and Liao, tensions were always high, and the threat of attack even higher. It just so happened that during one of these attacks, Alexander found himself at the epicentre of this incident. As battlemechs clashed overhead, Alexander was unable to flee, and as metal clashed above him, Alexander found himself crushed beneath tonnes of rubble.\r\n\r\n Alexander officially died that day. The man pulled from the wreckage and put back together by doctors was a very different man to what he had been before. Zenith could barely eat, his face damaged and scarred by the metal that had torn through it. His mind could no longer handle the challenges that it had before. Instead, his mind was focused on a new goal, making sure that no-one had to endure what he had gone through ever again. At the seat of a mech, Zenith hopes to write the wrongs of war, and protect the people that do not have the resources or the bravery to protect themselves.",
