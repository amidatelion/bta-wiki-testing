		"Details": "Jonas has had it hard, it never seems to go right for him. Originally a member of the LCAF, Jonas was recruited into Loki, the Lyran intelligence outfit, where he served with moderate distinction as he'll bitterly tell anyone who asks. It all took a turn for the worse when he met a lovely lady from the Free Rasalhague Republic and left Loki to be with her. Unfortunately, his superiors at Loki were displeased by this and sent assassins to silence him before he spilled secrets to anyone. While Jonas lived, his lady friend did not. Jonas, now on the run, was picked up by a minor merc company who saw value in an ex-spy. He learned to drive a mech and set about his new life. Unfortunately, again, he was forced to leave the company when they decided to side with the Steiners in the run-up to the Fed Com Civil War. Now he's drifting, looking for a new company to call home.",
