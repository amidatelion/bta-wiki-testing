		"Details": "Hairhelmet and his two sons, Austinian and Jeremidious, hail from New Olympia, in Marik space.  Much to their mother's dismay, the two children aimed to follow in their father's footsteps and become mechwarriors.  She would much rather have had them peacefully remain back and work the land of the agri-domes and spend time fishing.\r\n\r\nHairhelmet was originally a pilot, training at the Lloyd Marik-Stanley Aerospace School, but eventually decided that stomping was better than flying and ended up at the Allison Mechwarrior Institute.  He preferred fast scout mechs with high mobility.  After graduating, he served with the 13th Division.  With the rumors of the Clans coming, though, the family had to abandon New Olympia and set out to make their fortune with the mercenary companies among the stars.  Austinian was still too young to join, but Jeremidious was able to spend time at Allison, learning the art and science of the mechwarrior.",
