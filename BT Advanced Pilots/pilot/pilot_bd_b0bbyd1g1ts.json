		"Details": "Robert Andrews aka Gigs. His friends called him Bobby when he was small, back when he was growing up on Eutin. His fascination with machines was there from the beginning and with Eutin being the chief source for quickly-made, durable and cheap electronics for Tharkad, Gigs found himself never short of a spare part for replacement or repair or for an experiment.\r\n\r\n He was a mech tech in his youth and learned mechs inside and out but once the Clan invasion hit the Lyran Commonwealth and the the first defense wave didn't come home, every available qualified pilot suddenly found themselves in the cockpit instead of a simulator. It was a miracle he survived being a rookie back then, especially during those times but 10 or so years of Steiner military experience had turned the rookie into a veteran. His fate and the mechs' have always been tied and he figured he might as well be getting paid better for it by now.\r\n\r\n Not a lot of mechwarriors last this long but some are lucky and then there are some who learn how to make their own luck. Gigs' custom built for speed Cicada-CDA-3F includes an extremely rare, fully repaired and restored NULL Signature System he salvaged from surviving his first encounter with the Clans and ComStar. This good fortune turned his already fast moving target of a mech into a practically sensor-invisible moving target which helped the young Robert stay alive long enough to grow into the old Gigs that he is today.\r\n\r\nGigs is a good scout but he's better whipping his Cicada around as a back-stabber and has been known to turn his single ER PPC to some unfortunate backs when he can. You can find him online when he's not in combat.",
