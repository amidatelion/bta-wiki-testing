They were correct in that assessment as the final vestiges of resistance appear to have been stamped out by the Clan [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreTouman],touman]], bringing the cluster firmly under Goliath Scorpion control. While the Castilians are undoubtedly unhappy with the situation, it seems that little can be done about it as the Castilian and Umayyid militaries have been completely crushed and their remnants absorbed into the Scorpion [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreTouman],touman]]. What the Scorpions plan to do with their newly conquered territory remains unclear at this time.",

In a prepared statement, the ruling Council of Merchants has roundly condemned the Clan aggression against their neighbors, saying that the Hanseatic League will not stand for such blatant aggression in their region of space. [[DM.Factions[faction_ClanGoliathScorpion],Clan Goliath Scorpion]] has responded by saying that their intelligence indicates that the Hanseatic League fed the Castilian internal conflict for decades by selling weapons to both sides and thus should mind their own business, lest the Goliath Scorpions decide to take action to protect the new [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreEscorpi贸nImperio],Escorpi贸n Imperio]]. Clearly, a larger conflict is brewing in the Deep Periphery. More to come as this story develops.",
