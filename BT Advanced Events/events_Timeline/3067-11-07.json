The Conference's objective is two-fold; to determine the response of the Star League against the Clan threat and on any inter-House conflict, and to elect a new First Lord of the Star League for another three year term.  Outgoing First Lord Christian MÃ¥nsdottir is already on Terra, as are delegations from provisional members the [[DM.Factions[faction_TaurianConcordat],Taurian Concordat]] and the [[DM.Factions[faction_WordOfBlake],Word of Blake]] whom are seeking permanent membership in the League.  Notable absentees are the Chancellor [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSunTzuLiao],Liao]] and Magistrix Naomi Centrella.  Instead, Chancellor Liao sent a recorded message via courier, denouncing the Star League as nothing more than a \"hollow alliance of convenience that had already outlasted its usefulness.\"",

Observers note that by seizing Antallos, the Snow Ravens will not only stabilize the borders of their allies in the Outworlds Alliance, but secure advanced positions should hostilities resume with the Combine.",
