Meeting Prince [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreVictorSD],Victor Steiner-Davion]] and [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreClanWolfInExile],Clan Wolf-in-Exile]] Khan Phelan Ward, Vlad pointed out that the Truce of Tukayyid had expired and his Clan was free to attack the exhausted [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreLyranAlliance],Lyran Alliance]]. In exchange for peace, the Wolf Khan demanded that [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKatherineSteiner],Katherine]] be turned over to him. Prince Victor agreed without protest and Vlad left Arc-Royal with the newly renamed Katherine Wolf.",

Hansen's Roughriders in particular have shattered several Taurian commands in their pursuit of revenge for the Bromhead Massacre.
