Almost immediately after landing in early 3066, Blakist mercenaries [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreCliftonsRangers],Clifton's Rangers]] and [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreHannibalsHermits],Hannibal's Hermits]] began clashing with the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreCameronGuard],12th Cameron Guard]], outmaneuvering and ambushing the heavier Terran unit at every turn.  After months of combat, the Cameron Guard are retreating to their base for a final stand, but are calling for any reinforcements to aid in their defence.",
