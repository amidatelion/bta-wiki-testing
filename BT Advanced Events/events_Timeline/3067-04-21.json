President [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreIvanHeliusII],Ivan Helius II]] had this to say: \"The Rim Worlds Republic issues this challenge to Clan Wolf today: evacuate the worlds of the Oberon Confederation and allow the Republic to claim them or face our warriors in battle and be disgraced before our might.\" The Wolves could not be reached for comment but a representative did indicate that the Clan would be answering the challenge \"very soon\". This marks the second Clan that the Republic has engaged in combat, after the battles with [[DM.Factions[faction_ClanJadeFalcon],Clan Jade Falcon]] over the past several years (which ended with a punitive raid from the Falcons into RWR space in 3065). It is unclear what the Republic has to gain from this invasion, other than the ire of the Wolves. Only time will tell what President Helius' goal is.",

						"Details": "WOLF's DRAGOON UNITS LAND ON HALL, EPSILON INDI\r\n\n\nIn the aftermath of the death of Count McNally and the defeat of his remaining forces, Emperor \"Bud\" Baranov's control of Hall appeared complete.  The arrival of two [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreAMC],Allied Mercenary Command]] formations however completely changed the balance on the planet.  The Third [[DM.Factions[faction_DismalDisinherited],Dismal Disinherited]] landed and provided a refuge to the remnants of the anti-Baranov forces, including [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreBurtonsBrigade],Burton's Brigade]].  Meanwhile the other AMC formation, the [[DM.Factions[faction_Wolfs_Dragoons],Wolf Dragoon's]] Wolf Spiders Battalion, landed and began to investigate suspicions that the [[DM.Factions[faction_WordOfBlake],Word of Blake]] were supporting Baranov.  The Wolf Spiders almost immediately began to skirmish with a terrorist organization known only as \"[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreManeiDomini],The Bloody Hand]]\".\r\n\n\nIn a similar move, the Wolf Dragoons Zeta Battalion has landed on Epsilon Indi, where they began to clash with an unknown rebel force attempting to seize control of the world.  Both the pro-[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreTerranHegemony],Cameron]] and pro-independence factions on Epsilon Indi deny any ties with this rebel force, prompting even more speculation of it's origin.  Attack and defend contracts for all planets are available via the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMRBC],Mercenary Review and Bonding Commission]].",
