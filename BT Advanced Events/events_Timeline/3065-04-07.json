		"Details": "DRACONIS COMBINE ASSAULT FALTERS ON KENTARES IV!\r\n\n\nKentares IV, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreFedCom],Federated Commonwealth]]: For over 250 years, the world of Kentares IV has been a stain on the honor of the [[DM.Factions[faction_Kurita],Draconis Combine]] and House Kurita, both for the loss of the world to the [[DM.Factions[faction_Davion],Federated Suns]], and the subsequent [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKentaresMassacre],Kentares Massacre]] ordered by Coordinator Junjiro Kurita. When the Third Benjamin Regulars landed to retake the world as part of the reprisal for Sandoval's invasion of the Combine, only an irregular \"Kentares Draconis March Militia\" formed from fragments of the Clovis DMM and the Fifth Donegal Guards were on-station to oppose them. With little joint training under their belts, the irregular defenders were ill-prepared to rebuff the Combine advances and the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKuritaDCMS],DCMS]] initially made impressive headway. That all changed with the sudden arrival of the Tenth Lyran Guards in-system. With the Kentares DMM ahead and the Tenth Lyran behind, the Third Benjamin Regulars had no chance at victory. Nonetheless, the Regulars faced their impending demise in the proudest tradition of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKuritaDCMS],DCMS]], forming up for battle and perhaps earning back some of the honor lost all those years ago.",

Reportedly sporting the latest Capellan technology available, the Troika promises to drastically improve the AeroSpace capabilities of the Periphery nations, while the lower labor-costs of the Periphery allow the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreLiaoCCAF],CCAF]] to replenish its AeroSpace forces on the cheap. Mounting an LRM20 with 3 tons of CASE-protected ammo, a pair each of ER PPCs and ER Medium Lasers, and the heatsinking to fire them all continuously, the Troika is a capable medium fighter. Although currently available only to the armed forces of the Trinity Alliance, mercenary commands with AeroSpace wings should look for the Troika to be available on the open market late next year.",
