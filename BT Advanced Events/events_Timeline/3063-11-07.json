		"Details": "MARSHAL SORTEK FALLS ON NEW AVALON!\r\n\n\nNew Avalon, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreFedCom],Federated Commonwealth]]: The First Davion Guards, commanded by Marshal Bishop Sortek have long been a thorn in the side of [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKatherineSteiner],Katherine Steiner]], first refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to her rather than the Commonwealth itself, and then refusing to stand down, disarm, and submit to investigation for \"terrorism.\" After further negotiations failed, a Loyalist task force composed of the Third Robinson Rangers, the Tenth Deneb Light Cavalry, and Loyalist militia units embarked to disarm and arrest Sortek and the Guards. Breaking free of the task force and rendezvousing with faculty and cadets from the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreNAIS],NAIS]] College of Military Science and Albion Military Academy, Sortek's forces began an ultimately doomed campaign to liberate the Davion homeworld. With battlefield attrition taking its toll and no reinforcements available, Sortek reportedly enacted a plan designed to allow the bulk of his forces to evacuate. As the First Davion Guards made their way through Grand Avalon-Dalban pass to an unknown fate, Sortek and twenty-three handpicked warriors appear to have held the pass against the combined might of the Loyalist forces for over three hours. With the Guards depleted and bereft of their beloved Marshal, New Avalon will likely remain under [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKatherineSteiner],Katherine Steiner]]'s control for the foreseeable future.",

The system operates identically to a standard TAG with a 40% reduction in range, and a 50% reduction in weight. These weight savings allow the Light TAG to be more easily fitted to a variety of BattleMechs and Vehicles. While Clan-tech is often prohibitively expensive, the proliferation of Combine-produced Light TAGs should rapidly drive costs down.",
