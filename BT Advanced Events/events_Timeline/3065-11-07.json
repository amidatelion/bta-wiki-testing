Unwilling to directly assault a city full of civilians, Victor's generals simply surrounded the city for months, allowing the bulk of the civilian population to evacuate, while the Raiders waited for reinforcements in vain. When General Chapman's First Federated Suns Armored Cavalry began their attack on the city, they purposefully left gaps in their lines to allow the Raiders to 'escape' the city only to fall into the armored jaws of the 20th Avalon Hussars, spelling the end of the Second Chisholm's Raiders.",

Although long-rumored to privately prefer Victor, Duke Hasek loudly proclaimed at the Third [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreWhittingCon],Whitting Conference]] that he would <i>never</i> support either Victor or [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKatherineSteiner],Katherine]]. Apparently that announcement was too much for [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKatherineSteiner],Katherine]] to stomach, and in late October, a Loyalist task force consisting of the Eleventh Avalon Hussars, Fourth Donegal Guards, and the Ridgebrook Capellan March Militia arrived in New Syrtis, engaging Hasek's forces there. On 31 October, Loyalist troops landed on New Syrtis itself and a commando cadre reportedly attempted to assassinate Duke Hasek himself in his command center. Although unsuccessful, the Duke was apparently severely injured and left comatose by the attempt.",
