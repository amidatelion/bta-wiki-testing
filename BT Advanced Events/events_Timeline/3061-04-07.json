This decision comes after the previous Protector, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreJeffCalderon],Jeffrey Calderon]], was killed in a botched rescue attempt on Detroit where he was being held captive earlier this year. The decision was not without its challenges as Shraplen was a vocal critic of Jeffrey's policies and has openly vowed to change the Concordat's course if selected as Protector. The other major candidate, Baron [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreChamKithrong],Cham Kithrong]], has disagreed with Shraplen's selection but has pledged himself to \"the betterment of the Taurian state, regardless of who is Protector.\"\r\n\n\nWould you like to know more?",

Early reports indicate that this Clan, which has not yet been seen in the Inner Sphere, identifies itself as [[DM.Factions[faction_ClanFireMandrill],Clan Fire Mandrill]] and has been issuing Trial of Possessions against Clan Jade Falcon for local resources and personnel. It's unclear where the bulk of the Clan is situated, as only a handful of vessels have been spotted. Observers are concerned this may indicate a resumption of Clan hostilities despite the conclusion of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGreatRefusal],Great Refusal]].",
