[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreNewDallas],New Dallas]] was destroyed during the First Succession War and has been picked over by salvagers and scavengers occasionally ever since. The unnamed mercenaries were doing the same thing, looking for salvageable BattleMechs to bulk out their forces with, when they discovered a long-forgotten bunker sealed away beneath a destroyed dome city. Inside the bunker, protected against the ravages of the ages, were a handful of experimental Land-Air 'Mechs. The mercenaries quickly alerted the MRB and have begun selling the rare mechs to anyone willing to come pick one up at New Dallas!",

The New Dallas discovery marks the first time a LAM has been discovered in decades. This LAM appears to be based off of the Champion, a 60 ton Star League cavalry mech with a pockmarked record. How this Champion LAM performs is unknown at this time as records of its existence are unavailable since the original manufacturer, which appears to be Bergan Industries, has yet to provide any documentation on the mech's history.",
