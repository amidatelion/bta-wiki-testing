With the Shield Worlds open for business, mercenaries and merchants alike have flocked to the region. Mercenaries in particular have found plentiful work operating against the Alliance under the table while the Concordat officially denies any actions against the Alliance. Still, rumors indicate that the Concordat is paying good money for mercenaries to bother the Alliance and bring back salvage for study.",

While most Alliance members are tight-lipped, several have referenced governments in what is called the Sanctuary Worlds themselves, supposedly hidden deeper in the Periphery. These governments, the [[DM.Factions[faction_JacobsonHaven],Jacobson Haven]], [[DM.Factions[faction_MallardRepublic],Mallard Republic]], and [[DM.Factions[faction_DaneSacellum],Dane Sacellum]], seem to have a hand in the [[DM.Factions[faction_SanctuaryAlliance],Sanctuary Alliance]] itself and have quietly been expressing interest in the visitors from the Inner Sphere. Rumor has it that there is a debate about opening borders even further and letting visitors into the Sanctuary itself.",
