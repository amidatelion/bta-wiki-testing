Only with the arrival of [[DM.Factions[faction_MorrisonsExtractors],Morrison's Extractors]] did Dijonne and Port Vail -renamed Pain and The Rack respectively- rise back into prominence, if only as a nest of piracy and infamy.\n\n\nMorrison's Extractors, composed of ex-[[DM.Factions[faction_Circinus],Circinus]] [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreBlackWarriors],Black Warriors]] and originally led by \"King\" Hopper Morrison, moved to the pair of planets in the 3040s, setting up bases from which he could launch raiding parties. By the end of the 3040s, the Extractors had become the scourge of [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreLyranAlliance],Lyran]] worlds.\n\n\nWhile successful for nearly two decades, a sizable percentage of the Extractors were destroyed by the mercenary unit [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreAblesAces],Able's Aces]] in 3062 after a series of botched raids on [[DM.Factions[faction_RimCollection],Rim Collection]] territory.  Morrison's Extractors survived, however, and both they and other pirate bands continue use The Rack and Pain to launch raids into the Lyran Outback, and in the Periphery realms from the [[DM.Factions[faction_Marian],Marian Hegemony]] to the [[DM.Factions[faction_Chainelane],Chainelaine Isles]].",
