		"Details": "MERCNEWS PIRACY SPOTLIGHT: ASTROKAZY\r\n\n\nOriginally settled by the mercenary group Crimson Reapers seeking refuge after breaking contract with the [[DM.Factions[faction_Marik],Free Worlds League]], the Reapers soon fragmented into smaller and smaller groups, eventually becoming the ancestors of the nomadic tribes and city-states that existed for centuries.  Astrokazy became known not only for the constant low-intensity warfare between it's inhabitants, but also a world full of intrigue and espionage, where anything and everything could be - and often was - bought and sold.\r\n\n\nAstrokazy's location on the trade routes between the Free Worlds League, the [[DM.Factions[faction_MagistracyOfCanopus],Magistracy of Canopus]] and the [[DM.Factions[faction_Marian],Marian Hegemony]] soon attracted criminals, renegade Mechwarriors, unscrupulous traders and even ex-[[DM.Factions[faction_ClanSmokeJaguar],Clan Smoke Jaguar]] warriors.  Given its galactic position, and the fractious nature of the world's factions, Astrokazy is also a haven for pirates.  The most notable pirates bands currently operating from the planet are the raiders of the Idrisid Caliphate, the Blades of Death, and a new group calling itself the \"Order of the Faithful\".",
