In a dramatic twist of the deadlocked 2nd [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreWhittingCon],Whitting Conference]], Precentor Martial Anastasius Focht resigned, naming [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreVictorSD],Victor Steiner-Davion]] as his successor and new Precentor Martial.

As the new First Lord of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreStarLeague2],Star League]], it falls on Kurita to maintain the uneasy peace between the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGreatHouses],Great Houses]] and protect the Inner Sphere from the dormant Clan threat.",

He retained the title of First Lord of the Star League only long enough to ensure that the Conference concluded. As he stepped down, his eldest son, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreIanCameronIII],Ian Cameron III]], took his place as the new Director-General of the Terran Hegemony. Ian, named after both the legendary Cameron who founded the original Star League so many centuries ago and the young Cameron heir who escaped the clutches of [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreStefanAmaris],Stefan Amaris]] in order to protect the Cameron bloodline, was raised from birth to take the throne of the Hegemony. His father has expressed full confidence in young Ian's ability to lead the realm through the coming decades with skill and grace. For his part, the new Director-General has already indicated interest in strengthening ties with the other Great Houses and a firm belief in the power of diplomacy.",
