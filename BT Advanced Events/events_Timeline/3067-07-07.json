The vast majority have returned to Outreach, where the [[DM.Factions[faction_Wolfs_Dragoons],Wolf Dragoons]] offer extensive training facilities and workshops alongside their Hiring Halls to weary commands looking to rebuild.  Noted mercenary commands the [[DM.Factions[faction_BroadswordLegion],Broadsword Legion]], Waco Rangers, [[DM.Factions[faction_51stDarkPanzerJaegers],51st Dark Panzer Jaegers]], [[DM.Factions[faction_SmithsonsChineseBandits],Smithson's Chinese Bandits]], and the Tiger Sharks have been spotted on Outreach.

Additionally, all three nations have posted bounties for the death or capture of pirates and mercenary contracts to strike out at known pirate holds.",
