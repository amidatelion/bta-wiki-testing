Hosting a significant stockpile of consumables and materiel as well as extensive repair and refit facilities, Dalkeith represents a significant strategic asset for whatever faction can hold it. Stationed there before the outset of the FedCom Civil War, the Fourth Deneb Light Cavalry had stubbornly refused to declare for either side, hoping to serve as a deterrent force for any 3rd parties attempting to exploit the conflict. Unfortunately for the Fourth DLC, \"armed neutrality\" was not good enough for [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKatherineSteiner],Katherine Steiner]], and the Thirteenth Donegal Guard were deployed to Dalkeith to occupy the facilities and forcibly relieve the Fourth DLC. When the Fourth refused and shots were fired, the Civil War truly arrived on Dalkeith as the Fourth DLC openly declared for [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreVictorSD],Victor Steiner-Davion]].\r\n\n\nPlease stay tuned for a word from our sponsor.",
