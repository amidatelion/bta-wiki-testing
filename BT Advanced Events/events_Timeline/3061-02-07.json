President of the Colony Council Sherman Maltin and several rogue Colonial Marshals under his command took Magistrix [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreEmmaCentrella],Emma Centrella]] and Protector [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreJeffCalderon],Jeffrey Calderon]] prisoner in late 3060 and attempted to declare independence for the region in exchange for their freedom. Both the Magistracy and Concordat refused this claim, with Magistrix Centrella's daughter Naomi leading the rescue effort. Unfortunately, during the climactic shootout with the Marshals, Protector Calderon was killed in the crossfire, leaving the Concordat without a clear ruler.",
