Cater's Cohorts, who have long opposed Baranov's rule and hold several towns in the southern hemisphere, are gearing up to defend against Baranov's push by appealing for support from not only offworld mercenaries, but also from Count Radcliffe McNally.  The pro-[[DM.Factions[faction_Cameron],Cameron]] McNally, while also opposed to Baranov's rule, is no friend to the Cobras as both sides have engaged in mutual tit-for-tat raids over the years.  Count McNally for his part is holding his personal guard and supporting mercenaries [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreBurtonsBrigade],Burton's Brigade]] and [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreCritchleysCavs],Critchley's Cavaliers]] out of the fighting, perhaps hoping that both the Baronov's and Cater's forces will leave each other vulnerable for the Count's own offensives.",

The world has been plagued by piracy for some years, with the pirates under the command of the so-called Viscount Dvensky and his Bryant Regulars. House Cameron has never quite been able to clear them out and after they attempted a raid against the local HPG station, ComStar has taken matters into their own hands. The Viscount's days appear to be numbered.",
