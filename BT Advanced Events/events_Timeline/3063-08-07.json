The loyalties of the Fifth had long been with [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKatherineSteiner],Katherine Steiner]], and thus it came as no surprise that they were ordered to do their part in the ongoing FedCom Civil War. Apparently deployed to Axton to ensure the loyalty of the regional training battalion there, two DropShips belonging to the Fifth immediately collided and crashed on their arrival, with all personnel and equipment lost, while the remaining DropShips were reportedly scattered on entry. Their reception by the First Bell Training Battalion on Axton is unknown at this time.",

						"Details": "MERCMAN MECH REVIEWS: BOMBARD\r\n\n\nTen years after its utterly humiliating debut in the Davion Arena, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSolarisArms],Solaris Arms]] is at it again with a redesigned Bombard, though as we'll see, some of those design choices were questionable at best. No faster than the original, the new design trades the devastating power of two AC20s out for the range and weight savings of twinned Thunderbolt 15's. With the known vulnerability of the T-Bolt to Anti-Missile Systems of all types, it's hard to see what the designers were thinking there. Likewise, it's hard to say that [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSolarisArms],Solaris Arms]] did anything reasonable with the weight and space saved by the T-Bolts either. They added CASE, but for an arena mech with an XL engine all that means is bigger pieces to sweep off the floor. They added Spikes, but if their opponent is close enough for those to matter, the Bombard pilot has already lost. Ultimately, the grand arena experiment that was the Bombard seems to have blown up in [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSolarisArms],Solaris Arms]]' face. However, there appears to be a place for the Bombard in the unorthodox tactics and unit compositions of the Periphery, which was perhaps [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSolarisArms],Solaris Arms]]' goal all along.",
