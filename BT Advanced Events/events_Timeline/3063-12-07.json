Although occasional skirmishes between the Clanners are common, the raids have reportedly captured the attention of Dominion command, and [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKuritaDCMS],DCMS]] commanders have observed some limited redeployments of Dominion units. With elements of [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSandoval],Duke Sandoval]]'s Draconis March wreaking havoc in their backyard, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKuritaDCMS],DCMS]] commanders are sure to take advantage of the respite, however brief.\r\n\n\nPlease stay tuned for a word from our sponsor.",

The Clan, while still viewing this as mostly a minor inconvenience, is reportedly taking this new challenge more seriously and is meeting the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreRimRepublicanArmy],Rim Republican Army]] with more force than previous conflicts. Rumor has it that Khan [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMarthePryde],Martha Pryde]] is taking a closer interest in the Periphery realm's upstart behavior.",
