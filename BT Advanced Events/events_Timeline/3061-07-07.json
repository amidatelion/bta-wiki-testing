Helius managed the win after an extensive campaign against Roberts, highlighting the loss of many of the [[DM.Factions[faction_RimWorldsRepublic],RWR]]'s worlds to the Clan Invasion as well as promising to put more funding and resources into the [[DM.Factions[faction_RimRepublicanArmy],Rim Republican Army]] in order to better protect the realm from future aggression. In response to the projected loss, Roberts gracefully conceded the election, saying \"It was my honor to lead the Republic for as long as I have. I wish President Helius all the luck in the job, I know he'll need it.\"\r\n\n\nStay tuned for more.",
