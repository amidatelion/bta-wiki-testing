While Count McNally is no friend of Major Cater, it remains to be seen if the Count will take advantage of this situation for his own benefit or if the Hegemony will actively step in to police the situation.",

Duke Charles Flinlinger of Talitha, a minor [[DM.Faction[faction_Marik],Free Worlds League]] world that has been fought over dozens of times, has decided to assault the neighbouring planet of Tyrfing, ostensibly in the name of security. Talitha has been raided by pirates several times recently and Duke Flinlinger has been very vocal about his belief that the pirates are Hegemony-backed. This action against Tyrfing represents his attempt to punish the Hegemony for its interference in the duke's affairs. For its part, the Hegemony has categorically denied any involvement in pirate attacks against FWL worlds and condemns the duke's premature action. Director-General [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreIanCameronIII],Ian Cameron III]] has ordered the on-world [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreThirdHegemonyLancers],Third Hegemony Lancers]] to repulse the Iron Guard by any means necessary.",
