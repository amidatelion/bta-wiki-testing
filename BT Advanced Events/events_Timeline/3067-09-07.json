With the annexation of the planet, Baranov's last remaining threats to his power, [[DM.Factions[faction_ComStar],ComStar]]'s 397th [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreComguard],Division]], the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreAMC],AMC]]'s Third [[DM.Factions[faction_DismalDisinherited],Dismal Disinherited]] and [[DM.Factions[faction_Wolfs_Dragoons],Wolf Dragoons]] Wolf Spiders Battalion are now legally obligated to leave the planet.\n\n\nColonel John Marik-Johns of the Third Dismal however refused to recognize the authority of the Fourth Oriente Hussars who had arrived on Hall to enforce the League's annexation the planet. Convinced the whole thing was a Blakist ploy, Colonel Marik-Johns commanded his Third Dismal and Burton's Brigade to attack the Fourth Oriente, who were in turn supported by Emperor Baranov's troops including the Fourth [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreRepublican],Republican Guards]] and the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreStealthyTigers],Stealthy Tigers]].  The fighting is fierce and the AMC and FWL are calling for mercenaries for support.",

With the unexpected deaths of Simon McDonald in July, and Henry Gordon and Fiona McBride just three weeks ago, the [[DM.Factions[faction_NorthwindHighlanders],Northwind Highlanders]] have lost their four most senior Clan Elders.  Invoking escape clauses in their contracts, the First Kearny and MacLeod’s Regiment have terminated their service with the Draconis Combine and are headed home. Similarly, the Northwind Hussars serving the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreStarLeague2],Star League]] and Stirling’s Fusiliers (operating as part of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreAMC],Allied Mercenary Command]] in the Chaos March) will join the Second Kearny Highlanders already on Northwind. Once there, the Highlanders will select successors to the mantles of the fallen Elders.\n\n\nWith several regiments withdrawing from their stations, the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMRBC],MRBC]] projects that choice contracts will be in the offering to any reputable command with a B rating or higher.",
