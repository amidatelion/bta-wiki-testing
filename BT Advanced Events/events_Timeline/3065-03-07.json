Although still occupying worlds within the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreLyranAlliance],Lyran Alliance]], the presence of Inner-Sphere troops in their Occupation Zone coupled with the latest aggressions of Clan Wolf drove Khan [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMarthePryde],Marthe Pryde]] to the bargaining table with [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreAdamSteiner],Adam Steiner]] and [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreArcherChristifori],Archer Christifori]] culminating in one of the few cease-fires between Inner Sphere and Clan that did not involve a Trial of some kind. Per the terms of the cease-fire, any occupied worlds will remain occupied; thus, the borders between the Lyrans and the Falcons will change drastically as nearly twenty worlds change hands. In addition, Blair Atholl will remain a jointly held world, where both Jade Falcon and Lyran troops can gain combat experience against the other, arguably [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMarthePryde],Marthe Pryde]]'s primary goal for the incursion to begin with.",

With the cease-fire between Khan [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMarthePryde],Marthe Pryde]] and [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreAdamSteiner],Adam Steiner]] now in place, the Falcons have the perfect place to vent their anger: the Rim Worlds Republic's ill-timed offensives into Falcon space. Reports indicate that the Falcons have already struck out with several punitive attacks against the RWR, striking a number of border worlds with the intent of punishing the Periphery realm for their continued insolence.",
