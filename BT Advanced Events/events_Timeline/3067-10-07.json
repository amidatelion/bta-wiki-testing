Meanwhile, the Tiger Sharks—a mercenary battalion returning from night exercises on the practice fields-made a drive for Harlech's DropPort. As chaos reigned in the streets, the [[DM.Factions[faction_51stDarkPanzerJaegers],51st Dark Panzer Jaegers]] and a mixed regiment of smaller mercenary groups joined with the attackers, driving toward the planet's Hiring Hall.\n\n\nThough badly shaken by these cowardly attacks, the surviving elements of the Wolf Dragoon's Home Guard, Zeta Battalion and the Wolf Spiders reacted swiftly. Severely outnumbered, they managed to buy enough time for survivors of the Dragoon's Beta and Epsilon regiments to get to their weapons, while Wolf Dragoon units on the continent of Remus have reportedly been called in to support a counteroffensive led by [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreJaimeWolf],Jaime Wolf]]. These forces will augment those which have already gathered at Commander Wolf’s order, as well as allied mercenary forces such as Battle Magic and the [[DM.Factions[faction_BroadswordLegion],Broadsword Legion]].",

While the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreAMC],AMC]]-aligned Third [[DM.Factions[faction_DismalDisinherited],Dismal Disinherited]] and [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreFWLM],FWLM]]'s Fourth Oriente Hussars grind away at each other, the remnants of [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreBurtonsBrigade],Burton's Brigade]] and the slain Count McNally's House Guard - led by Captain Elly Burton herself - led a headhunter assault on Emperor \"Bud\" Baranov's position.  Reports indicate Captain Burton succeeded in killing Emperor Baranov in a 'Mech duel at the cost of her own life.  The [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreStealthyTigers],Stealthy Tigers]] and the remnants of Baranov's Fourth [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreRepublican],Republican Guard]], now freed from crushing Burton's Brigade, are now moving to assist the Fourth Oriente against the suddenly outnumbered Third Dismal. In response to Baranov's death, House Cameron has finally authorized the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreTHAF],THAF]] to send in forces, specifically the 8th Hegemony Rangers regiment to support the AMC-aligned mercenaries against the rebellious forces attempting to secure Hall for the Free Worlds League.",
