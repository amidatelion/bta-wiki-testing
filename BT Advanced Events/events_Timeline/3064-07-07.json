Nearly all interstellar freighters have been ordered to a general stand-by in case the cargo capacity is needed by the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSteinerLCAF],LAAF]] for transshipment of military goods, with only essential foodstuffs and fuel being reliably transferred. With shortages civilian staples reported throughout the Lyran trade zone, underworld elements have quickly developed a thriving black market. What civilian trade is allowed through is even more vulnerable than usual to pirates, as most military units have been either deployed or ordered to stand-by indefinitely. As always, when the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGreatHouses],Great Houses]] fight, civilians pay the price.\r\n\n\nPlease stay tuned for a word from our sponsor.",

With 14 tons of armor and an arsenal to make an Atlas blink, the Challenger was built to take on BattleMechs and win, all at a fraction of the cost<sup>1</sup>. A powerful 270XL engine propels the Challenger to speeds of up to 54 km/h, while a MainFire Point Defense Anti-Missile System enhances the already impressive survivability. In addition to the base model, GM-Kallon is now offering the Model XI command-fire support variant incorporating a C3 Master system and the Model XII variant utilizing a C3 Slave and Guardian ECM. Already adopted by such illustrious units as the Davion Heavy Guards, the Challenger is the perfect addition to mercenary command's garage. \r\n\n\n<sup>1</sup><sub>Local prices may vary.</sub>",
