It was to be a neutral planet where anyone could come to do business.  Wildly successful during the Star League, the planet was ravaged during the Succession Wars.  The planet's civilization collapsed and the domed city-states became lawless jungles where only the strongest survived, while the Free Zones between the cities are controlled by \"Zone Gangs\" - vicious nomadic marauders.\r\n\n\nAntallos still maintained a reputation as a place where anything could be bought or sold, and over the centuries has attracted the worst of humanity.  Antallos is home to outlaws aligned with every major organized crime syndicate within the Inner Sphere, pirates, renegades, outcasts, prospectors, adventurers and political extremists.  Interestingly, Antallos became home to a small but growing collection of dezgra Clansmen and survivors of Clan [[DM.Factions[faction_ClanSmokeJaguar],Smoke Jaguar]] after Operation BULLDOG. Now belonging to the Clans' [[DM.Factions[faction_DarkCaste],Dark Caste]], these survivors, of all types, formed their own version of a Zone Gang named \"Dark\".",

Also during this time, pirate king Vance Rezak and the [[DM.Factions[faction_BandOfTheDamned],Band Of The Damned]] established their own estates on the outskirts of the city-states. The two powerful factions clashed with each other over the course of years, until 3065, when the Vigilantes command collapsed following a failed assault on the Band, the Vigilantes survivors joining the Band peacefully. The Damned is now the powerful faction on the planet, and their raids range from the [[DM.Factions[faction_Outworld],Outworlds Alliance]], the [[DM.Factions[faction_Kurita],Draconis Combine]], the Clan OZs an even into the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreDeepPeriphery],Deep Periphery]].\r\n\n\n[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMRBC],MERCENARY REVIEW AND BONDING COMMISSION]] PIRACY REPORT:\r\n\n\nOutreach, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreFedCom],Federated Commonwealth]]: Attached are the latest reports of pirate activity throughout the Inner Sphere and Periphery.
