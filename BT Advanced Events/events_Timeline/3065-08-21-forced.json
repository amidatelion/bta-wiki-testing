When it became clear that they would not hold the capital, the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreCouncilofMerchants],Council of Merchants]] displayed the depths of their treachery, detonating a nuclear booby trap, leveling much of the capitol city and annihilating tens of thousands of lives, civilians and soldiers alike. Shocked, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreRudolfSchmidt],Captain-Marshal Rudolf Schmidt]] ordered his remaining troops to cease hostilities immediately as he hoped to save what remained of his people. [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMagonScott],Khan Magon Scott]] of the Goliath Scorpions accepted the Captain-Marshal's surrender though [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreRDF],Regional Defense Force]] 3 refused to stand down and was summarily executed at the hands of the Scorpions (who flew into a frenzy at the senseless destruction wrought by the merchants).",
