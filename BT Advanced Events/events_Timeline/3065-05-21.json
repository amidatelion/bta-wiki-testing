		"Details": "MERCNEWS PIRACY SPOTLIGHT: STAR'S END AND THE NEW BELT PIRATES:\r\n\n\nA former mining system, Star's End holds just one planet; however several large asteroid belts cover the system which make navigation to the planet extremely hazardous without intimate knowledge of the approaches. Star's End is particularly notorious for being the place where First Lord Simon Cameron died in a mysterious accident in 2751. By the 31st century the system was also known for being a haven for pirate bands.\r\n\n\nThe current inhabitants, the [[DM.Factions[faction_NewBeltPirates],New Belt Pirates]], were formed with the remnants of [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreRyansRebels],Ryan's Rebels]] -under pirate queen [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSusieOneEye],Susie \"One-Eye\" Morgraine-Ryan]]- merged with the the existing Belt Pirates under Morgan Fletcher II.  Surprisingly, the new pirate band recorded a series of successes against the Clans, particularly [[DM.Factions[faction_ClanWolf],Clan Wolf]], capturing supplies and even taking possession of a number of Clan OmniMechs. Other pirates and ex-mercenaries began flocking to the New Belt Pirates' banner, growing the pirate's ranks until the Clans could no longer ignore their menace.  In April 3064, Clan Wolf's [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreOmegaGal],Omega Galaxy]] finally cracked down on the New Belt Pirates on Star's End.  Surprisingly, the pirates gave a good accounting of themselves, and while they took heavy losses, the pirates ultimately survived the Clan Wolf assault.  After a period of licking their wounds, the New Belt Pirates are well on their way to regrowing their ranks, each success propelling Morgraine-Ryan and Fletcher to new heights of power and infamy.",
