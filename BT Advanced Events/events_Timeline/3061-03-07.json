In that time, Task Force SERPENT engaged [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreClanSmokeJaguar],Clan Smoke Jaguar]] with the intent to wipe out the Clan entirely and emerged successful after Archon-Prince Victor faced and defeated Khan Lincoln Osis in what is being called the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGreatRefusal],Great Refusal]]. With the destruction of Clan Smoke Jaguar, Victor and the SLDF have secured peace for the Inner Sphere from the Clan menace, though not without great cost. The task force suffered massive casualties, going from ten regiments to less than two over the course of the conflict.",

Both states consider this conflict a \"civil war\", as does the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreStarLeague2],Star League]], meaning that the two nation states are on their own to resolve the conflict. The First Lord of the Star League, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreChristopherCameron],Christopher Cameron]] of the [[DM.Factions[faction_Cameron],Terran Hegemony]], has offered to serve as a mediator between the Confederation and the Compact but to date neither nation has accepted his offer.",
