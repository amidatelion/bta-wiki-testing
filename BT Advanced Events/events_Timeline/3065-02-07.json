In the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSkyeProvince],Isle of Skye]], long a troublesome province in the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreLyranAlliance],Lyran Alliance]], what were once the mere grumblings of a discontented populace are becoming the louder calls for independence. The so-called \"[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreFreeSkye],Free Skye]]\" movement has been further emboldened by the words of Duke [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[TBoneLoreRobKelswaSteiner],Robert Kelswa-Steiner]] after his marriage to Hermione Aten, Duchess of Skye. Although ostensibly loyal to [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKatherineSteiner],Katherine Steiner]], Duke Kelswa-Steiner has publicly stated his displeasure at \"the free people of Skye being used as pawns in the squabbles of [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGreatHouses],Great Houses]],\" and the possibility of open revolt looms.",
