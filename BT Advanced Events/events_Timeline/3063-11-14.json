However, the Alliance's intentions have now become clear as they have staged a major assault against the Tortuga Dominions. The current pirate ruler of the Dominions, Major Twyla Sumeral, has issued a call to all nearby pirate forces to defend the Dominions with a promise that any destroyed Sanctuary forces are open for salvaging by their killers. Various pirate bands are reported to be fighting on behalf of the Dominions, including the Death's Consorts and the Tortuga Fusiliers.",

To paraphrase a Federated Suns Outback March planetary official: no one likes pirates but at least they're predictable. Both the [[DM.Factions[faction_Davion],Federated Suns]] and the [[DM.Factions[faction_Outworld],Outworlds Alliance]] have ordered military units to their nearest borders with the [[DM.Factions[faction_Tortuga],Tortuga Dominions]] in an effort to ensure that the conflict does not spill over into their space. The [[DM.Factions[faction_TaurianConcordat],Taurian Concordat]] has also placed the TDF on alert to watch for possible treaty violations in case the [[DM.Factions[faction_SanctuaryAlliance],Sanctuary Alliance]] decides to expand this operation into the Concordat again.",
