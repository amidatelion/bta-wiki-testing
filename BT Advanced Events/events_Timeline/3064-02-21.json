However, scattered reports from the area indicated that the pirates weren't down for the count just yet. These reports have since been confirmed as Major Twyla Sumeral, former ruler of Tortuga, was seen on Astrokaszy securing support from other pirate bands to help retake her domain. More recent reports show that the major has secured the allegiance of 6 full pirate bands and intends to take back her worlds by hook or by crook.",

Both powers have kept various military forces on their nearby borders, just in case the unknown attackers decide to expand once again. A spokesperson for the Federated Suns, when asked about the build-up of pirate ships traveling through Suns territory on their way to the Tortuga Dominions, said only that the Federated Suns is watching carefully to be sure the pirates did not vary their course. It seems that the Suns are content to watch the brewing conflict without interfering, likely due to the ongoing Federated Commonwealth conflict.",
