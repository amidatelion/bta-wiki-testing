To his surprise, they did and in the calm that ensued the 62-year-old doyen of the Lyran military met with both surviving Loyalist commanders.  Acknowledging the bravery of both units, General Steiner announced his intention to resume command of the Second Donegal and to move against the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreFreeSkye],Free Skye]] rebellion, while the Seventh limped back to Launam.  After twenty-two months of fighting, the Fourth [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreCrucisLancers],Crucis Lancers]] -now permanently including the survivors of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreComguard],Com Guard]] 167th Division who had been disavowed by Precentor-Martial-Pro-Tem, Gavin Dow- remained in control of Giausar, ending one of the most savage conflicts of the Civil War.",
