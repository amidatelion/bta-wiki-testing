The two nations have been posturing against each other for more than a year at this point and minor raids have taken place several times against each other but after the slaughter of a team of Goliath Scorpion Seekers on Bergen by Hanseatic security forces [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMagonScott],Khan Magon Scott]] of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreEscorpiónImperio],Escorpión Imperio]] asked the Clan Council to support an invasion of the League, to which the Council granted their unanimous support.",

It seems that the League's [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreRDF],Regional Defense Force]] in the area, RDF 9, is spread between the worlds evenly and was not prepared for a full-scale invasion.
