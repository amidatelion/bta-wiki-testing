Surprising many, the Snow Raven admiral was reportedly \"impressed\" by the skill of the Outworlds pilots, and quickly requested a parlay and the opening of a \"dialogue\" between the Periphery nation and the Clan. Rarely has a Clan used dialogue when arms would suffice, and the opening of relations between the Alliance and [[DM.Factions[faction_ClanSnowRaven],Clan Snow Raven]] could have lasting implications for the stability of the region.",

Using the immense facilities of the Titan Naval Yards, the <i>Guarded Knowledge</i>, <i>Hidden Meaning</i>, <i>Immortal Spirit</i>, and <i>Blake's Sword</i> were all added to the rapidly growing rolls of the [[DM.Factions[faction_WordOfBlake],Word of Blake]] Navy. As the Blakist military build-up continues, observers are left pondering the uses to which these new WarShips may be put. A spokesperson from the [[DM.Factions[faction_WordOfBlake],Word of Blake]] issued a statement saying the manufacture and stockpiling of military goods and myriad mercenary contracts are \"necessary to ensure the safety and security of the faithful.\"",
