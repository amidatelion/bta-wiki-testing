The Cavaliers chose for their encampment Fort Theodore Jannus, a decommissioning and storage facility for outdated weapons and ordnance, giving them a ready supply for use in their defense. As the Lancers approached under a withering volume of fire, the Cavaliers apparently began using ordnance found in several of the storage bunkers, and at some point in mid-July made the fateful decision of firing several volleys of unmarked artillery shells. Many of these shells were apparently chemical and gas rounds, causing horrific casualties among the Lancers RCTs, and causing [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[TBoneLoreTancredSandoval],Baron Tancred Sandoval]] and General Acabee Zardetto to pull back and reassess the situation. A Loyalist spokesperson has vehemently stated that the chemical and gas rounds were used entirely in error, the Royal Cavaliers are reportedly conducting a full inventory to assure such a mistake does not happen again.",

However, the Loyalist Seventh Donegal were well-positioned to ambush their landing, and with most of the Com Guards' command structure and half of their force strength annihilated in the landing. Linking up with General [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[TBoneLoreAndrewGiggins],Giggins]] and the Fourth Crucis, the combined unit continued to harass the Loyalists until a Seventh Donegal strike team was able to assault Giggins' HQ company, spurring a vicious fight which [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[TBoneLoreAndrewGiggins],Giggins]] narrowly escaped. The combined Fourth Crucis and 167th counter-attack inflicted heavy casualties on the Loyalists, and on 9 September a scout company engaged the Loyalist Second Donegal HQ company, severely injuring General [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[TBoneLoreDelmarVoss],Delmar Voss]] and crippling the Loyalist command structure.",
