By using Warships to blockade the Supremacy worlds, denying them critical foodstuffs and choking off interstellar trade, the Supremacy was forced into protectorate status in 3062.  With the gradual replacement of Sarna's mercenary garrisons with those from the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreLiaoCCAF],CCAF]], and the lining the Supremacy's government with pro-[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreHouseLiao],Liao]] officials, the formal absorption of the Sarna Supremacy into the Confederation was a long predicted outcome.",

The [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSheratanKnights],Sheratan Knights]], while canny, have mostly been defeated by Grim Determination after years on conflict. However, the hunt for their backers began in earnest after it was discovered that the Sheratan Knights may have been supplied by elements of the [[DM.Factions[faction_WordOfBlake],Word of Blake]]. As Grim Determination are aligned with the AMC and the AMC is explictly opposed to Word of Blake interference in the affairs of sovereign worlds, conflict appears inevitable as the mercenaries begin to root out Blakist agitators amongst the population of Sheratan. As the Word of Blake stirs conflict throughout the Hegemony's border worlds, the AMC stands ready to stand against them wherever they must.",
