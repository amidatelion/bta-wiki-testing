After willingly joining the Terran Hegemony in the late 3030s, Elgin has slowly developed a pro-[[DM.Factions[faction_Marik],FWL]] sentiment among the populace, many of whom wished that the Hegemony would be more of a benefit than it seemingly has been (the reality of the details of the Hegemony's rulership is, apparently, irrelevant). After years of growing discontent, the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreDiemofElgin],Diem of Elgin]], Jeffery Ling, has formented an open revolt against the Cameron family and has declared his intention to join the Free Worlds League. [[DM.Factions[faction_Cameron],House Cameron]] has responded with force, sending the 9th Cameron Cavaliers to Elgin to put down Diem Ling's revolt and bring peace back to the world.",
