		"Details": "The ill-conceived clone of Darius, Dariuus is only 17 years old, speed-grown in a grey-market cloning facility. Originally intended to be a failsafe replacement for Darius Prime, Dariuus was slated to be sold to an organ farm when the cloning facility on Artru went under. Darius Prime rescued his clone and brought him back to the Argo to find his way as a mercenary. With neural imprinting from Darius Prime and experience operating IndustrialMechs at the facility, Dariuus is a surprisingly good MechWarrior. Unfortunately, the imprinting process and accelerated growth has made him a little...unstable.",
