However, you couldn't just have a quiet drink in peace and now there's... someone sitting across the table from you. You'd heard of him before, a rumor really, running around the various hiring halls in the region. That mask he wears is unmistakable after all. The firm and commanding voice coming from beneath it asks his question again. \"Well, Commander {COMMANDER.LastName}, you've heard my offer. I join your crew and I bring my 'Mech, Akulakhan, with me. In exchange, you don't ask any questions about me or my background.\" Darius leans over and whispers, \"This guy might be bad news, you sure we want him on board? Think carefully here, boss.\"",

You may consider Dagoth Ur, Lord of the Sixth House at your service. I will make arrangements for delivery of Akulakhan to your vessel shortly.\" As he walks away, Darius speaks with some trepidation. \"You sure about this, Commander? We've all heard the stories about that guy, that he's on the run from something and that he brings bad omens to any ship he travels on. You're taking an awful chance with him here.\" You chuckle quietly. \"Darius, we're all on the run from something in the end, I'm alright taking a chance on a MechWarrior, even if he's a little weirder than most.\"",
