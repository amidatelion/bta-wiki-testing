What greets you upon entering the room is...well, two Dariuses. Darii. One is <i>definitely</i> taller than the other, and you realize that the shorter of the two is the Darius you've known all along.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"H-okayyy...who wants to start?\"\r\n\r\nDarius Prime begins \"Commander, I'm sorry for all this. This is my...clone, I guess. For the last few years, I've been spending all my earnings on an...insurance policy. I opened an account at a gray market cloning facility, with instructions that if I ever died, they'd release my clone and send it...him...to replace me. Well, the facility went under and a clone-rights sympathizer sent me a message warning me that they were just going to farm all the clones out for parts. I couldn't let that happen, which is why I had to leave. I sent my clone back first, in case I didn't make it. He's the only family I've got left.\"",
