Y'all thought I was crazy. Well, I will be mocked no longer. I got a motion sensor tripping in the Mech Bay right now. Get over here so we can confront them.\"\r\n\r\nYou rub the sleep from your eyes, put on your uniform, and rush to the Mech Bay. This will be settled one way or another.\r\n\r\nWhen you arrive you spot Yang peeking in: \"It's almost like someone is trying to dance in that {SCN_UNIT.Chassis.Description.Name}. It's not even half bad. Did you see the torque on that pirouette?\"\r\n\r\nPuzzled you watch on, until the pilot gets out. It was the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[Wulf_Lore_Cook],Cook]] all along.",
