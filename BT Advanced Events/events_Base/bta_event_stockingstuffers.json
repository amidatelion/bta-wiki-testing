		"Details": "Sitting at your desk in your quarters on the night before Christmas, you sipped your hot cocoa (which [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[TooltipSimGameCharacterDARIUS],Darius]] managed to procure at your last resupply somehow) and ruminated on the season. Ah, Christmas! A magical time for all the good girl and boy MechWarriors, a time of magic and mystery, and you had a feeling this year was going to be something special indeed. Just like clockwork, a message popped up on your console with a graphic of a stocking above a fireplace, hung with care. Intrigued and expecting one of [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[TooltipSimGameCharacterSumire,Sumire's]] jokes you clicked the message only to be met with a picture of a laughing Santa Claus and the text \"Merry Christmas, Commander! Tell me, were you good or bad this year?\" You ponder for a moment and click the appropriate response.",
