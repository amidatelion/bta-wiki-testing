Apparently, this individual wants to send us some suits of [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreBattleArmor],Battle Armor]] and a few APCs to accompany them. Are we interested in the offer? Should I contact them back and accept?\"\r\n\n\nYou muse on the idea for a moment, long enough for Yang to pipe up, \"I'd say yes, Commander! [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreBattleArmor],Battle Armor]] is a great recent invention and will give us a bunch of fun new tactical options in combat!\" Farah shakes her head at Yang's enthusiasm, \"[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreBattleArmor],Battle Armor]] are also fragile and difficult to keep in operation due to needing constant repairs and fresh pilots. Do we want to put our pilots through that kind of difficulty in combat?\" After hearing their perspective, it's time to make a choice.",
