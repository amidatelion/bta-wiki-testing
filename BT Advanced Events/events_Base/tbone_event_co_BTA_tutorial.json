Normally I'd decline an offer like this without bothering you, but they're actually willing to pay us a decent wage to participate on top of covering all repairs and refits out of their own stocks. Seems they don't have the personnel to play the parts of both Aggressor and Defender. What they do have is a surplus of training-spec [[DM.MechDefs[mechdef_urbanmech_UM-TD],UrbanMechs]] and Demolishers so they're willing to let us drop in as the Aggressor force. No salvage allowed, but I'm not sure we'd want a bunch of old Urbies anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We have a number of green pilots in the barracks, so this could be a good chance to let them get a feel for combat, as well as for you to see how they perform. We'd be deploying immediately, however. What do you think?\"",
