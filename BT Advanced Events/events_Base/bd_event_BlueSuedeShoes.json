It seems that the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSnordsIrregulars],Snord's Irregulars]] are selling off some material after their clash with Victor-aligned forces on Odessa. Included in the lot of material they're selling is a one-off FrankenMech made by one of their MechTechs, Shorty Sneede. Seems that Sneede met his end on Odessa and the unit is selling his 'Mech. I guess it used to be a Rifleman but is heavily modified now. I've got a contact with the Irregulars and could reach out if we're interested in buying the 'Mech? It's a little expensive and I have no idea what precisely we'll be getting but having a 'Mech from the very famous Irregulars has gotta look good to employers.\"",
