You've slugged several of the crew for insulting your honor. I need to know I can trust you. I have to ask: Will you be able to face your former comrades in battle if we take contracts here? The company has invested a considerable amount of time and money into you, and I'll see it paid off, one way or another.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must admit that given the opportunity, I would rejoin the Falcon [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[TBoneLoreTouman],<i>touman</i>]] rather than face them in combat. However, for me to betray your trust would render me <i>dezgra</i> I would not do so. Bid me fight them, and I will fight them. Bid me leave, and I will go with nothing but the clothes on my back. I will not stay and have my honor questioned.\"",
