Apparently a MechWarrior matching Max's description was captured trying to sneak into a Forward Operating Base with a bomb, and is currently being held in a secure facility in New Bergen before his scheduled execution. Predictably, Darius wants to mount a rescue op and Sumire is arguing against it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Commander. I know Max made a mistake, but I don't like the idea of leaving him to the Clanners-\" Darius begins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But actions have consequences. Max knew the risks, and I don't think we should have to pay for his stupidity-\" Sumire interrupts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Enough, both of you! Let me think it over. Dismissed.\"",
