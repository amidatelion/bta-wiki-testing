	"Name": "Nueva Castile",
	"Details": "Nueva Castile is a small star cluster of nine systems far corewards from the Inner Sphere, closer to the Clan Homeworlds than the Inner Sphere itself. Settled during the Star League era, Nueva Castile has been embroiled in a low-level war with the Umayyid Caliphate, invaders from outside the cluster, for centuries with neither side able to make much ground against the other. The technological level of Nueva Castile is low and life is hard in the region.",
