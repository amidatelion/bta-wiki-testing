	"Details": "The Hanseatic League's military is organized into a series of Regional Defence Forces, or RDFs. Each one is led by a Captain-General except for RDF 1 which is led by the Captain-Marshal (who is formally in charge of the entire military structure and sits on the Council of Merchants). While the RDFs vary somewhat in combat skill and available war material, they all share the same fanatical loyalty for the League and its people.",
