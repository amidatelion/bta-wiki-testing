    "Details" : "The Ambassador-class BattleMech was a unique design pioneered by the First Star League. Offered to any high-ranking diplomatic or political figure who wanted one, the Ambassador was intended for face-to-face negotiations that could not take place over a vidscreen. It became a point of pride for Inner Sphere dignitaries to care for their Ambassador and keep it in tip-top shape. After the Star League fell, the design ceased production and most existing chassis were stripped for parts, though rumor has it that ComStar and later the Word of Blake restarted limited production of the design on Terra.",
