    "Details" : "Starting their life as a brigade of volunteers in the defense of Robinson, the Draconis March capital world, these original volunteers were wiped out during the First Succession War. To honor these volunteers, Prince Peter Davion authorized the construction of two BattleMech regiments.  The Robinson Rangers fought the Draconis Combine Mustered Soldiery from the time of their inception. Two things define the Rangers: Hatred of the Combine, and more importantly, a loyalty to the Sandoval family.",
