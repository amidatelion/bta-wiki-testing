	"Details": "Sheridan 'Doc' Cobble is certainly a doctor, and he has the diploma to prove it. That it's from the Chesterton School of Veterinary Medicine doesn't seem to concern him since he says we're all just bags of meat either way. His hands are just as steady whether he's stitching up a MechWarrior or helping a cat cough up a furball, and assuming you aren't bothered by the cigarette constantly hanging out of his mouth, a mercenary could do much worse for medical care.",
