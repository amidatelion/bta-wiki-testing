    "Details" : "During the Star League era, many nations expanded dramatically thanks to Star League technological assistance and the Outworlds Alliance was no exception. However, after the Star League fell, the Alliance realized it could no longer fully support and so withdrew from many of its outlying worlds which led to their demise. These worlds formed the so-called Outworlds Wastes and are a barely inhabited wasteland of forgotten planets.",
