	"Name": "ComStar Protectorate",
	"Details": "Formally established shortly after the fall of the Star League, the ComStar Protectorate was a small cluster of worlds around Terra that ComStar claimed for itself during the chaos of the Succession Wars. The Protectorate was ostensibly formed to support ComStar's efforts to maintain the HPG network by providing the raw resources required to upkeep and build new HPGs around the entire Inner Sphere. Over the centuries, various other worlds in the region formally petitioned to join the Protectorate and were accepted (to varying degrees of response by the Great Houses). The Protectorate's true purpose was unveiled in 3036 when it was transformed into the core of the reborn Terran Hegemony.",
