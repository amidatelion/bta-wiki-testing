	"Details": "Oldest child of First Prince Hanse Davion and Archon Melissa Steiner and heir to the Federated Commonwealth, Victor Steiner-Davion is already a living legend at the age of 32. Hero of the Clan Invasion, the 3058 Jade Falcon incursion, Operation BULLDOG, and the Great Refusal, it is impossible to overstate the impact he has already had on Inner Sphere politics. Technically the rightful ruler of the unified Federated Commonwealth, he has so far been unwilling to challenge his sister Katherine for the title.",
