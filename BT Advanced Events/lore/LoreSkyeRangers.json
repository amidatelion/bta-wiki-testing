    "Details" : "Originally the army of the Federation of Skye, where the Skye Rangers were once synonymous with courage and resolution. Lately, many in the LCAF and LAAF see them as divisive for their ties to the Free Skye movement. The Skye Rangers have maintained close ties to its parent state, recruiting almost exclusively from the Skye Province. As such, the unit frequently sides with the leader of the Skye region, not the Archon.",
