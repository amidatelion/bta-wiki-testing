Masquerading as pirates under the banner of 'the Red Corsair,' they eventually made their way back into the Inner Sphere and overthrew the Archon.\r\n\r\nAfter Arthur Luvon's death, Morgan Kell and his brother Patrick founded the Kell Hounds mercenary unit. While initially dismissed by the greater mercenary community, the Kell Hounds rapidly rose to become one of the preeminent mercenary commands in the Inner Sphere.\r\n\r\nIn a lifetime of legendary service to the Lyran Commonwealth and later the Federated Commonwealth, Morgan Kell currently holds the title of Grand Duke, and leads the Arc-Royal Defense Cordon.",
