	"Name": "Snord's Irregulars",
	"Details": "Snord's Irregulars are a mercenary company that dates to the early 3000s. Famous for their unusual proclivities and obsession with old Terran pop culture and music, the Irregulars often go out of their way to acquire collectables they're interested in, such as going so far once as to temporarily abandon a posting in order to recover a crate of rare liquor the CO wanted. Their mechs are as colorful as their obsessions, often being painted wild colors and even including a FrankenMech or two in their number.",
