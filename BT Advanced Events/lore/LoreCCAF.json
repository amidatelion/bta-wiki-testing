    "Details" : "The Capellan Confederation Armed Forces is the military of the Capellan Confederation. Often regarded as one of the weakest of the Great House militaries, the CCAF's skill levels vary widely between its various regiments, leading to the CCAF having a poor reputation in the Inner Sphere. However, in truth, the CCAF is a highly disciplined and well trained army, used to fighting against impossible odds and somehow snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. Only fools would underestimate them, as history has shown time and time again.",
