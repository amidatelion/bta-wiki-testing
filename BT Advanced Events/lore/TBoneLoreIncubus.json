	"Details": "With weaponry that is easily disabled to balance the firepower of the mech with that of an armored Elemental, the Incubus was designed for use in Trials amongst bored garrison units. The Incubus uses an XL Engine, Endo Steel frame, five and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor, and primarily is armed with medium-range weaponry. A Large Pulse Laser covers decent range, while it is supported by a pair of ER Medium Lasers and four Machine Guns.",
