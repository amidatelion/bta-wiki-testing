	"Name": "Clan Goliath Scorpion",
	"Details": "Clan Goliath Scorpion was one of the original 20 Clans founded by Nicholas Kerensky following the Second Exodus, though it was not selected for the invasion of the Inner Sphere undertaken in 3049. Clan Goliath Scorpion is little-known to the Inner Sphere, having never had a major presence in the Sphere, but is reknown for their ritualistic use of the drug necrosia and for their tendency to send out Seeker parties looking for the relics of the First Star League (which the Clan reveres as nearly sacred).",
