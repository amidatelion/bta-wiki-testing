    "Details" : "The Vanguard Legion is a mercenary regiment noted for their involvement in the search for the Clan Homeworlds.  Their prior contracts with Comstar and the Draconis Combine have allowed them to field a high proportion of mechs with Clan and Kurita designs.  After a contract where they encountered \"difficulties\" with the Lyran Alliance, the Vanguard Legion now demonstrates a deep indiscriminate hatred for all Lyrans.",
