	"Name": "Ibex RV",
	"Details": "The Ibex RV is a relatively recent design from Earthwerks Inc. It is powered by an ICE engine that gives it a top speed of 80km/h and maximum range of 500km. The Ibex RV is protected by relatively light BAR 4 armor, but is highly maneuverable in tight quarters. Designed with maximum cooling in mind, the Ibex can have trouble maintaining optimal manifold temperatures in arctic environments.",
