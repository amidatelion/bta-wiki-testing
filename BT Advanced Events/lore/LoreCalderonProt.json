    "Details" : "The Calderon Protectorate is a small Periphery state located spinward of the Taurian Concordat. The Protectorate began as a collection of small settlements newly-colonized by the Taurian Concordat, an effort which started with the Far Lookers movement and was backed by Concordat financial interests.  Though not interested in independence initially, the Protectorate declared itself a separate nation in the wake of recent policies of the Taurian Concordat.",
