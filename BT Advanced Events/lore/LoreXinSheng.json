	"Name": "Xin Sheng",
	"Details": "Xin Sheng or \"New Birth\" is the name given to Chancellor Sun-Tzu Liao's military and civilian reforms to restore the pride of the Capellan Confederation. The Xin Sheng movement included reorganizing the CCAF, including creating a new General-equivalent rank, Jiang-jun. All ranks were given new names in Chinese. Mercenary units with long histories of service to the Confederation (McCarron's Armored Cavalry, among others) were nationalized into the CCAF, often with citizenship and titles for the commanders and owners. In addition, as part of Xin Sheng, the CCAF moved to reclaim worlds lost in old wars, most notably the worlds of the St. Ives Compact and the Tikonov region of the Chaos March. The reintegration of these worlds into the Confederation was the culmination of the Xin Sheng movement.",
