	"Details": "Battle armor refers to heavy power armor-equipped infantry. The improved resilience, atmospheric containment, and firepower of battle armored infantry make it more effective than standard infantry in a variety of roles, but much more expensive. Many battle armors are strong enough to physically rip armor and myomer from enemy BattleMechs, and battle armor swarming tactics are commonplace.",
