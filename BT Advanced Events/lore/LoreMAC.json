	"Details": "McCarron's Armored Cavalry (MAC, The Big Mac) was once one of the largest and most successful mercenary units in existence. After having spent a large portion of its history in Capellan employ, McCarron's Armored Cavalry joined the CCAF around 3060. In return, the commander received a noble title and each member was granted citizenship. Even as a regular House unit, they remain a semi-independent fighting force.",
