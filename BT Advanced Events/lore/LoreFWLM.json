    "Details" : "The Free Worlds League Military (FWLM) is the armed forces of the Free Worlds League from that nation's founding in 2271.  For much of its history, the FWLM operated its units independently, but the Fourth Succession War and Andurien Secession taught them the value of using combined-arms tactics. To that end, different types of units were organized into one unit and ordered to work together.",
