	"Name": "Convoy Defense Force",
	"Details": "The Hanseatic League's navy is organized into a series of Convoy Defence Forces, or CDFs. The name is somewhat unusual for a military force but since their primary mandate is protecting merchant vessel convoys and driving away pirates the name seemed fitting. While small, the CDFs are highly trained and CDF 1 in particular is among the very best naval forces anywhere in the Periphery.",
