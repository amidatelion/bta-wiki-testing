	"Name": "Treaty of Micros",
	"Details": "Signed in June of 3063 by the Taurian Concordat and the Sanctuary Alliance, with observers from the Aurigan Coalition and Magistracy of Canopus in attendance, the Treaty of Micros brought and end to more than a year of bitter, brutal conflict between the signatories. It stipulated that the Sanctuary Alliance would cease all hostile operations against the Concordat immediately and would assist the Concordat in replenishing the depleted Taurian Defense Force. Finally, the treaty also stipulates the return of many of the Alliance's captured worlds to the Concordat, though notably not all worlds captured by the Alliance were accounted for.",
