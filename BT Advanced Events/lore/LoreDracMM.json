    "Details" : "The Draconis March Militia Regimental Combat Teams are the last line of defense for the Federated Commonwealth's Draconis March. The Draconis March Militia units are known to be loyal to House Sandoval. Centuries of raids, and the horror of the Kentares Massacre make sure that no member of the DMM will trust any DCMS officer. The d√©tente between the Draconis Combine-Federated Suns caused them a great deal of worry.",
