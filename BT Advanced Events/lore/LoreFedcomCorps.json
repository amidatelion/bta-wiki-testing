    "Name" : "Federated Commonwealth Corps",
    "Details" : "The Federated Commonwealth Corps's origins stem from the initial spirit of joint cooperation that led to the founding of the Federated Commonwealth in 3055. Their first unit, originally titled the First Federated Commonwealth BattleMech Regiment, was created from Melissa Steiner's wedding gift to Hanse Davion of a regiment of BattleMechs.  Outfitted with the finest equipment and with personnel from all parts of the Federated Commonwealth, it is a mixed unit of both Federated Suns and Lyran Commonwealth academy graduates.",
