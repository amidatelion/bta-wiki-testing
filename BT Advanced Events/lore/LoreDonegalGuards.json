    "Details" : "The Donegal Guards began their existence as the military force for the Protectorate of Donegal, and later the Lyran Commonwealth. Even after the formation of the Lyran Alliance, the Donegal Guards remain one of the nation's military cornerstones. They have been well supplied and equipped throughout their history, as the Donegal Province was spared the worst of the damage in the Succession Wars. The Donegal Guards are noted for their dogged determination, with their inclusion in a campaign being seen as a sign of the High Command's resolve.",
