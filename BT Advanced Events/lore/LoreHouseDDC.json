	"Details": "Warrior House Dai Da Chi is part of the Capellan Warrior House Orders.  These Warrior Houses are semireligious military orders within the Capellan Confederation, independent from the regular Capellan Confederation Armed Forces. They are a unique feature of the Capellan military, and well known and feared throughout the Inner Sphere.  The Warrior Houses report directly to the Chancellor and are placed under the command of the Strategios only at the Chancellor's direction.  House Dai Da Chi is most bellicose of all Warrior Houses, they strive towards martial excellence and are noted for hard training and high attrition rates. They are the only Warrior House to field two 'Mech battalions, and one of only two maintaining their own aerospace assets.",
