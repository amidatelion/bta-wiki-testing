    "Details" : "Paula Trevaline was born in the pirate kingdom of the Tortuga Dominions and rose through the ranks to become supreme leader of its legions in 3015. Captured and incarcerated in 3042, she recently escaped her New Syrtis prison in the chaos of the FedCom Civil War and has resumed her status as one of the most feared pirates in the modern era.  Her reputation for bravado and cruelty inspires devotion in her followers as much as it does fear in her enemies.",
