    "Details" : "The Cater's Cohorts was formed by former Fourth Republican Guards personnel who had turned against William Baranov shortly after he seized the capital of Hall.  After defecting, Major Cater's rebellious troops were forced to withdraw to Hall's southern hemisphere, and settled into a pattern where each faction raided their respective territories, occasionally fighting each other for supplies and territory.  Cater's Cohorts are a mixed force of roughly battalion strength.",
