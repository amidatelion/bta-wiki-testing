	"Details": "With the Second Star League's inauguration, the need for a unified defensive army was realized and so the Star League Defense Force was brought back into existence to serve as the Second Star League's military arm. Consisting of elements drawn from several sources, including the Eridani Light Horse and Clan Nova Cat as well as various donated Great House units and mercenary commands, the SLDF proved its great worth in battle with the destruction of Clan Smoke Jaguar in Operation BULLDOG and Task Force SERPENT.",
