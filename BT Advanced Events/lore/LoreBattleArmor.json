	"Name": "Battle Armor",
	"Details": "Battle Armor is a fairly recent addition to the warmaking inventories of the Inner Sphere. Introduced to the IS by the Clan Invasion with the Clan Elemental suits, Battle Armor are represented as a squad of between 4 and 6 armored troopers with small-scale weapons. Battle armor squads are capable of mounting other units for transport or to attack them at point-blank. However, they take a great deal of micromanagement to use effectively and can be difficult to keep supplied with good weapons.",
