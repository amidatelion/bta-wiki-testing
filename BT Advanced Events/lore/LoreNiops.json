    "Name" : "Niops Association",
    "Details" : "The Niops Association is a small, independent Periphery nation consisting of three inhabited worlds orbiting a single dying star.  The Niops system was colonized by the Star League to conduct the first study of a falling star based on generations of direct observation. The population has since grown with waves of refugees of the Succession Wars.  The Niops Association still boosts Star League levels of technology, abundant geothermal energy and access to fusion engines.",
