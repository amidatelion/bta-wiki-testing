	"Name": "Aleksandr Kerensky",
	"Details": "Born 2700, died 2801. General Aleksandr Kerensky was the last Commanding General of the Star League Defense Force and is most known for his role in defeating the Usurper, Stefan Amaris, after his duplicitous conquest of the Star League. After defeating Amaris in the bloody Amaris Civil War, Kerensky attempted to hold the Star League together but despite his best efforts the League collapsed under the weight of the Great House's ambitions. Kerensky then elected to undertake the Exodus and led the remaining Star League Defense Force members out of the Inner Sphere, where, eventually, they would become the Clans of Kerensky.",
