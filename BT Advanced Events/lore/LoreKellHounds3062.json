    "Details" : "One of the most legendary mercenary companies in the Inner Sphere, the Kell Hounds were founded in 3010 by Morgan and Patrick Kell. The Kell Hounds quickly rose to prominence in the Successor States through a combination of tactical acumen, strategic brilliance, and superior technical aptitude.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Patrick Kell on Styx in 3027, Morgan Kell ended his self-imposed life of exile on Zaniah to reassume leadership of the Hounds.  Since then, they have grown to two regiments and participated in every major conflict since the Fourth Succession War.  Along with Clan-Wolf-in-Exile, the Kell Hounds currently form a core contingent of the Arc-Royal Defense Cordon, watching both Clan Jade Falcon and the Crusader Wolves.",
