	"Name": "Lyran Alliance",
	"Details": "Under the rule of Archon Katherine Steiner-Davion, the former Lyran Commonwealth seceded from the Federated Commonwealth, becoming the Lyran Alliance. The Alliance is located coreward and anti-spinward of Terra, and is still the wealthiest of the five Successor States of the Star League, with an entrenched and powerful noble class. The focus on pedigree and prestige among the nobility has often resulted in less-than-brilliant officers being elevated to high command, to the detriment of the Alliance's military strength.",
