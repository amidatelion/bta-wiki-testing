	"Name": "Terran Hegemony",
	"Details": "Founded 2315, Dissolved 2767, Reinstated 3035. The Terran Hegemony is one of the original great powers of the Inner Sphere and is centered on Terra itself. The Hegemony claimed many of the systems surrounding Terran for itself over the early decades of its existence and quickly grew to dominate the fields of interstellar relations, technological advancement, and military innovation. It was the foundational state for the first Star League under Director Ian Cameron and its collapse in the Amaris Civil War was what lead to the Succession Wars as the other Great Houses fought bloody and brutal wars over its remains. Thanks to the machinations of ComStar and the discovery of surviving Cameron heirs, the Hegemony was reborn in 3035 out of the body of the ComStar Protectorate.",
