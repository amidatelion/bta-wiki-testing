	"Name": "Second Star League",
	"Details": "After the Jade Falcon incursion of 3058, Director-General Christopher Cameron called a conference on Terra and invited all the other House Lords, as well as the leaders of the Free Rasalhague Republic, the St. Ives Compact, ComStar, and Clan Wolf-in-Exile, to discuss the creation of a new Star League and the drafting of a new Star League Constitution. The new constitution was built on the framework of the original Star League's, with the interesting provision that the position of First Lord would rotate every three years and that no one lord could serve twice until all other leaders had served once. After great debate, the Second Star League was inaugurated in November 3058 and Director-General Cameron was elected First Lord.",
