    "Details" : "Appearing in the Chaos March in the 3060s, the terrorist organization known as The Bloody Hands is a complete mystery. Who they are, where they come from, or what their aims are is completely unknown. They do not respond to comms and do not offer any of their own.  At best it is surmised the group is backed by a powerful organization, possibly Capellan in nature, with access to tremendous resources. They are highly elite warriors and are equipped with seemingly the best technologies available. Beyond that, nothing is known about the force.",
