	"Details": "Considered a formal Clan Trial of Refusal, the Great Refusal was the challenge between the Second Star League Defense Force (led by Victor Steiner-Davion) and the might of the Clans themselves on their homeworld of Strana Mechty in Clan space. In a running course of eight engagements, the SLDF emerged victorious against the Clans with five victories for the SLDF, two for the Clans, and a single draw. By the rules of the Clans, the SLDF won the trial and put an end to the Clan Invasion of the Inner Sphere.",
