    "Details" : "The standing army of the Rim Worlds Republic. Originally a veteran's association in the Rim Worlds Republic, in the waning days of the Amaris Civil War the RRA was one competing group for leadership of the crumbling nation. Eventually, the RRA was brought into the political polity led by Mikael Helius and became the core of his new military, the Republican Provisional Army. After the SLDF left the Republic and the Lyran assault of 2776 was repulsed, Mikael Helius reorganized the military and renamed it to the Rim Republican Army, the name it still holds to this day.",
