    "Details" : "Located at a great distance from the Inner Sphere, the Clan Homeworlds is the star cluster settled by Nicholas Kerensky and his 20 Clans after the Second Exodus. The Homeworlds are resource-poor and miserable to live on but the Clans thrived there nonetheless, eventually building up, refining their technologies and warfighting skills, and finally returning to the Inner Sphere in the Clan Invasion of 3049.",
