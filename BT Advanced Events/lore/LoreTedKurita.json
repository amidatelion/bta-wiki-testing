	"Name": "Theodore Kurita",
	"Details": "Coordinator of the Draconis Combine since his father's <i>seppuku</i> in 3054, Theodore has little patience for petty Inner Sphere political squabbles, preferring to remain focused on the Clan threat. He instituted the Phoenix Programs targeted at rebuilding the DCMS, and recruiting heavily from non-traditional sources such as women and <i>yakuza</i>. However, even these modest reforms have met with significant opposition from hard-line traditionalist factions within the Combine.",
