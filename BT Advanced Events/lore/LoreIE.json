    "Details" : "Formed in 2974 with the merger Star Group and Mutual Exploration Network, Interstellar Expeditions performs mundane tasks such as genealogical research as well as more esoteric pursuits like stellar cartography, archaeological digs, anthropological investigations, and researching into lost colonies and Star League-era storage depots.  Interstellar Expeditions also hires mercenary commands to carry out a nebulous range of services that go from escort duties, security operations, investigations (criminal or otherwise), and other ad hoc tasks that might be required depending on the location and the situation.",
