	"Name": "Terran Hegemony and ComStar Relationship",
	"Details": "The Terran Hegemony was reborn by the deeds of ComStar, exploding into being out of the ComStar Protectorate in 3036. After the Hegemony's rebirth and eventual acceptance as a part of the interstellar political scene, ComStar stepped back from the political stage somewhat. Now, ComStar serves as a semi-independent branch of the Hegemony government, with Primus Gardner Riis serving as a special advisor to the Hegemony's Director-General. ComStar also maintains the HPG network in most of the Inner Sphere still, though the Great Houses are largely unhappy with that fact.",
