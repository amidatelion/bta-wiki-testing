	"Name": "Toro BattleMech",
	"Details": "First produced in 2481, the Toro is the first truly original BattleMech produced by the Taurian Concordat. A light fire-support design, the Toro fought bravely on the front lines against the Star League in the War of Star League Aggression (more often known as the Reunification War) but was not enough to save the Concordat and fell out of production. However, in the early 3000s the Concordat put the design back into production as a way to boost national pride.",
