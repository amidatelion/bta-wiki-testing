		"Details": "While the planet is rather inhospitable, extensive mineral wealth led to mining companies establishing a number of outposts in the area. To entertain themselves during their multi-year contracts on planet, these employees would begin setting up bloodsports with converted industrial mechs, eventually becoming what would become known as the Cradle Games, held every 3 years. While not at the scale of Solaris VII or Noisel, the arenas drew a respectable following.",
