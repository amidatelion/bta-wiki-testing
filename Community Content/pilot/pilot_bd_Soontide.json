		"Details": "Soontide grew up on Jamestown in the Hyades Cluster of the Taurian Concordat. His early life was pretty simple. His father was a MechTech while his mother ran a small school for the community children in the little town that had sprouted up around the mech repair facility where his father worked. That all ended when mercenaries, Soontide still doesn't know who hired them, attacked the facility. They didn't care about collateral damage or civilian casualties. Soontide was apprenticed to his father during that time and, seeing the attackers, jumped into a construction mech and tried to defend the facility. He failed to stop the destruction of the facility, but did survive.\r\n\r\nHe then spent some time doing what work he could. Piloting a mech for Kali's Live Fire Casino, Collections for Kurita, Kurita and Liao attorney's at law, etc.  After a period of time he finally decided to try his luck in the merc game. He hopes to, one day, run into the company that leveled his home.",
