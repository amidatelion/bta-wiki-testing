		"Details": "Jameson 'GhostWolf' Wheeler, originally from the Lyran Commonwealth, started out as any aspiring Mech pilot out in the Periphery does, and that's stealing a mech from a drunk Capellan pilot. Luck would have it, said pilot had an Atlas. After escaping with the mech, he started doing mercenary contracts, built a bit of a reputation on being a sharpshooter, and earned enough C-Bills to build a startup lance of mercenaries. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, on one contract his lance was taken out by a group of Death Commandos led by that same drunk Capellan who GhostWolf stole their Atlas from. GhostWolf did pay that drunk Capellan back by shooting their replacement Mech's cockpit into scrap before being forced to eject. Because of that incident and losing his mech, he says to every prospective employer 'It's too much paperwork to buy a new Atlas for myself and have it shipped here, so I'd rather sign up for another merc company and pilot their Atlas'.\r\n\r\n Also if you're wondering about the wolf ears, all GhostWolf knows is he got knocked out one night at a party with a bunch of Canopians and woke up in a ditch with an artificial set of wolf ears.\n\n <b><color=#e51717>COMMUNITY CONTENT</color></b>",
