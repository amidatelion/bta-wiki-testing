		"Details": "Logan was always going to be a MechWarrior. He talked about it constantly. Models and games, posters and comics, anything 'Mech related he had. He joined the Lyran Military, attended Coventry Military Academy and rapidly became a Lieutnant. However, sometime during the Clan Invasion he left service with his Mech, and became a Merc. His shot is a bit rusty, and his reaction time isnt as fast as it was in training, but his mind is sharp as a knife still.\n\n <b><color=#e51717>COMMUNITY CONTENT</color></b>",
