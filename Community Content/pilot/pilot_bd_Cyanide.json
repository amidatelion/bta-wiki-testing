		"Details": "The son of popular Solaris gladiator, Miranda 'Roughshod' Fandango, the future seemed a straight line to getting Charlie into a cockpit before he could walk. Simulator time went hand-in-hand with a rich education in philosophy, literature, and history, at the insistence of his father, an educated man. Everything seemed poised for Charlie to ascend alongside his mother as the next prominent Fandango of Solaris, when the Clan invasion came.\r\n\r\nMiranda used her celebrity to have her son, then just 16, assigned to a listening station and computational hub on a remote system's moon- in the hopes of keeping him safe. Meanwhile she enlisted to put her abilities to use in service of the Free Rasalhague Republic, placing her right in the path of the clan's stampede towards Terra. It wasn't long before Charlie received word that both of his parents perished at the hands of the clans, but there was very little he could do stationed alone on a deserted moon.\r\n\r\nStranded, Charlie occupied his time in a VR mech simulator he cobbled together from spare parts, and with a historical entertainment database hidden in archival files. This archive was packed with early-20th century entertainment files from big band music to noir films. Always a quick learner and with seemingly little else to do, Charlie taught himself to dance the lindy hop using old movies, and he brought that agility and sense of free flowing movement into his mech piloting.\r\n\r\nIt was in the middle of his second year cut-off from most of civilization that Charlie uncovered a mothballed garrison mech in a hidden basement storage area. It wasn't much to look at, and took months to bring back online, but Charlie managed to reactivate this FLE-15 just a few days before war spilled over onto his back doorstep. The mercenary unit tasked with thwarting the clan attack on his little backwater moon was quickly routed, all save one Black Knight piloted by their commander, and a pair of artillery units ready to rain hell from a safe distance. Charlie suited up and joined his first real battle at 18, managing to draw fire of the remaining clanners, and to scout targets for the artillery, but his safe haven was leveled in the process.\r\n\r\nImpressed with his natural abilities, the company commander offered Charlie a life as a mercenary mechwarrior, and he's never looked back.\n\n <b><color=#e51717>COMMUNITY CONTENT</color></b>",
