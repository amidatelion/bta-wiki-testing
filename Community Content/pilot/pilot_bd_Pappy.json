		"Details": "A Founding member of Pafftek Industries, with his siblings and members of his former mercenary company 'Hell-wolves,' Michael Eisenhorn was the madman behind the Battlehammer Frankenmech. In the years since the cobbled monstrosity of the Battlehammer, Pappystein, and Pafftek Industries have flourished as a refit/re-engineering company across the inner sphere. Serving every major faction and discriminating against none of them. It is likely the reason Pappystein, as well as Paffetek Industries, stays out of the mainstream news.\n\n <b><color=#e51717>COMMUNITY CONTENT</color></b>",
