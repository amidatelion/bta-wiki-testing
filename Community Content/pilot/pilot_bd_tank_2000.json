		"Details": "Born to a merchant family in Lyran space Pascal was kidnapped by pirates at the tender age of 14. He later found himself with the pirates on a moon outside of Lyran space. After half a year there was still no ransom payment, the pirates slowly started to like him and then they finally let him work on their battle armor and their tanks, so he learned various things such as how to use machines and how to deal with pirates or people from the underworld in general. After three years, the pirates finally gave up demanding a ransom for him and simply gave him the opportunity to shape his own life. \n\n Whereupon he received an offer from the pirate captain to join them, but he declined because he wanted to go back home to Lyran space and continue living his life there. He then traveled to the next inhabited planet, where he found a mercenary commander who talked about carrots and flavor packages all the time. He was then temporarily responsible for recovery and savage operations then continued to learn how to handle tanks and mechs and to assert himself in life as a mercenary, as well as how logistical operations should work. \n\n Eventually, he arrived in Solaris 7 where he lived for some time. At the age of 18 Trampel enrolled in the Lyran military and pursued a career as an officer. He was particularly distinguished for his leadership skills in the area of logistics and so after several years of service in the military, he was given command of a logistical unit which he commanded for an extended period. He became known there as a doer instead of an armchair sitter and worked very closely with his subordinates. One day the logistical center he commanded was attacked by enemy mercenaries who were equipped with several tanks and two light 'Mechs. The mercenaries began to destroy the base and kill his subordinates. Because Trampel didn't want to let this go, he got into a quad industrial mech and used it to defend the base. Since it didn't have more than just a bit of additional armor and infantry defense weapons, it just had to step over and ram the enemies. Trampel managed to defend the base but at the cost of being seriously injured after his cockpit was hit. \n\n As a result he was seriously wounded, especially both of his kneecaps were destroyed. His kneecaps were replaced with prostheses but he was subsequently discharged from the army with honors. Finally, now discharged, he set out to become a mercenary once again.\n\n <b><color=#e51717>COMMUNITY CONTENT</color></b>",
