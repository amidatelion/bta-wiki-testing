		"Details": "Chris' early adult hood led him to having a falling out with his family and setting out on his own to the far reaches of the Periphery taking on side jobs to get by. Eventually one of those jobs let to a steady career in small time corporate security logging in some of his first real time in a mech. Eventually as the years went by the company accumulated too much debt and was liquidated, but not before Chris stomped off in his company  mech.\r\n\r\nAfter a short stint pulling some bounty hunting work, one of his old co-workers got in touch leading to Chris signing on with his first merc company. The days bled together and one contract just rolled into another as Chris struggled to make a living. Eventually a disagreement over a contract with his employer led to Chris leaving, in hopes of finding greener pastures. He started his own mercenary company with little more than a Commando to his name. Eventually as his reputation grew along with company, Chris was offered a contract which promised a big payout and maybe a chance to retire. It was not meant to be it seems, as his entire company was wiped out in brutal urban combat stretching over weeks. Chris walked away from it, but he walked away as he started, alone.  He's now  looking to sign-up with whomever will take him and not ask too many questions about his mech along the way.\n\n <b><color=#e51717>COMMUNITY CONTENT</color></b>",
