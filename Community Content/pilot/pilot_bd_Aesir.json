		"Details": "Making contact with long lost colonies was not unusual for the ComStar Explorer Corps, but even they were surprised to discover a mostly functional Star League era base on an otherwise undeveloped and uninhabited world. Stranger still were the pair of brothers who had taken up residence in the complex. Whether they were the only survivors of whatever befell the facility, or merely stumbled upon it themselves, remains unknown. The brothers prefer not to elaborate. Offering information on the installation in exchange for a ride, the brothers took up the mercenary way of life upon reaching the inner sphere.\r\n\r\n The younger brother, Brian, adopted the callsign Aesir - a reference to the terran Norse gods of war. He is rotund and seemingly uncoordinated on foot, but he is surprisingly graceful when piloting his mech. He has an intuitive grasp of the ebb and flow of battle, where to be and not to be, such that he frequently emerges unscathed from otherwise sticky combat situations.\r\n\r\n <b><color=#e51717>COMMUNITY CONTENT</color></b>",
