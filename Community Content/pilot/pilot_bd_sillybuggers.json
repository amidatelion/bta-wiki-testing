		"Details": "Scott Paine aka Sillybuggers was a construction 'Mech mine worker on Astral Australis known to be a bit of a joker. One day he took a joke too far with a local mercenary band and one of them challenged him to a fight, his company ExcavatorMech against their Panther-SB. Making a deal with the company he works for, he took the ExcavatorMech out.\r\n\r\nThe fight would take place in an abandoned iron ore mine pit where the heat put out by the mine walls worked against the Panther ultimately shutting it down but not before it virtually destroyed Scott's ExcavatorMech. As part of the deal with the mining company Scott would have to work off the debt by defending the planet for 3 years. Scott built up his own band of misfits and mercenaries then when the service was finished he started out taking contracts around local space to work up a reputation.\r\n\r\nWhile on the original contract he learned of the Panther-SB's signature Binary PPC and fell in love the weapon and once he was free from the company he set out to find some more wherever he could. Scott and his merry band of Prankstars have made a decent reputation as showing up to a system and having a good time while driving off pirates and other neâ€™er-do-wells.\n\n <b><color=#e51717>COMMUNITY CONTENT</color></b>",
