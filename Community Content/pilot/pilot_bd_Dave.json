		"Details": "Born on Terra, Geoff knew the universe was a big place. Once he started star hopping, he couldn't stop. He made it into something of a career, visiting exotic places, meeting people, and telling his signature explicit jokes. And anywhere he went, at his side was Barristan, his bulldog.\r\n\r\nTo pass the time while travelling, Geoff took up two hobbies. One was simple, 'pumping iron' as it was known on Terra. Even in Low-G, Geoff could be found thinking up ways to strain his muscles. He also brought with him a historic relic known as 'StarCraft'. This is where he first used the InControl callsign. The cult following of the game soon took notice of Geoff, and he quickly rose into the spotlight for his play and personality. It also helped pay the bills, as he earned money competing and then coaching others.\r\n\r\nAfter a few years, Geoff decided that commanding from a VR tube wasn't enough, and joined up with a mercenary crew. Skills learned from Starcraft such as battlefield awareness, positioning, and target selection all translated to the real battlefield well. Duels (legitimate or illegal) are his favorite, with just his 'Mech and his wits to rely on and take down the enemy. With Barristan at his side (and painted onto his 'Mech), InControl continues to travel the stars, visit exotic places, and work his big guns.\n\n <b><color=#e51717>COMMUNITY CONTENT</color></b>",
