		"Details": "Trueborn in 3033, Euphemia Rosse is a bloodnamed warrior of Clan Nova Cat. Euphemia was an oddball among her sibko - quiet and standoffish while her sibmates were gregarious, and a Warden where most were Crusaders. Nonetheless, they were all close, and it was their bond that allowed them all to pass their trials of position- a rare achievement.\r\n\r\n Shortly afterward, Euphemia began receiving visions - vivid, allegorical portents of the future, whenever she burned a Vineer. Attributing this to her Rosse bloodheritage, Euphemia sought out Oathmaster Biccon Winters for guidance, eventually striking up a friendship. Ultimately, Winters became her mentor and patron, with Euphemia studying the Clan’s history and harboring aspirations of eventually becoming Oathmaster herself.\r\n\r\n During the clan invasion, Euphemia first saw action on Irece, where she scored two kills in her Locust IIC. However, her next deployment was Tukkayid, during which Euphemia would lose her mech, all of her sibkin, and almost every other person she knew. She survived only thanks to the collective efforts of her star, and they were trothkin - found family, after that.\r\n\r\n Assigned to garrison duty on Irece, Euphemia and her star became involved in a chain of events that culminated in an alliance with a spheroid mercenary company. She would then join them as a liaison for the Clan, clandestinely working to further Nova Cat interests through plausibly deniable actions. Given the opportunity to travel far and wide, she broadened her horizons, learning much about spheroid culture and tactics while fighting alongside her new lancemates. Eventually coming to consider them her trothkin as well. She even found a paramour among them, though it took three years and several misunderstandings for them to begin their relationship.\r\n\r\n Her role as a liaison played a part in convincing the Nova Cats to join the Star League, and in addition to this Euphemia managed to earn her Bloodname in the months leading up to Operation Bulldog. Riding a Shadow Cat, she took part in the Great Refusal and fought alongside her lover, now an SLDF Mechwarrior, during the Nova Cats’ abjuration.\r\n\r\n  With Minoru Kurita robbing her of her longtime goal, and the horrors of the abjuration weighing heavily upon her, Euphemia has once again elected to serve as a mercenary liaison for the Clan, taking solace in her travels and the company of freer spirits. She and her partner still write to one another frequently, though she keeps her growing loneliness private.\n\n <b><color=#e51717>COMMUNITY CONTENT</color></b>",
