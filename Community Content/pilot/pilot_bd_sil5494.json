		"Details": "A persistent enigma, Seraph has a longer story than anyone but perhaps he knows. Records are inconsistent but what you can find indicates he appears to have fought for and against virtually every faction in known space at one time or another over a period of time that would make him far older than is plausible, even with the best technology available today. Beyond that, he is listed as MIA or KIA on several independent instances, several distinct times.\r\n\r\nThe one thing you can be sure of is that he carries himself like a veteran and seems equally comfortable in a command chair or the cockpit of just about anything that rolls, stomps or floats.\n\n <b><color=#e51717>COMMUNITY CONTENT</color></b>",
