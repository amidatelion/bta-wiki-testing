		"Details": "Not much is known about Anthony’s past. He claims to be from the area around Gravenhage, although there are no records of anyone with his name on world prior to a few years ago. His career began in a militia unit on Gravenhage, and his career with them was relatively uneventful. While being generally liked by his lance mates, he has been perceived as slightly strange, even by border world standards. It was once mentioned that his unit was going to see some action in the border skirmishes with Clan Ghost Bear, and it was probably the first time anyone in the unit saw Anthony show any sort of real excitement. When this opportunity didn’t come to pass, and the unit was sent to another Periphery border, Anthony submitted his resignation. He attempted to take his prized Marauder with him, but he didn’t get out of the armory before the security controls shut it down.\r\n\r\n What is known about Anthony is that he seems to have a knack for understanding LosTech, and favors using a Marauder if one is available. His cooling vest is unusual in the fact that it appears to have four jagged scratches designed into it like clawed by a wild animal. There is a lot of speculation in his former unit as to what his origins may really be. Some have even noted that his appearance seemed to coincide with recent raids by an unknown group in the region of Kuritan space where he is from. Regardless of that speculation, he has proven himself to be a reliable pilot, even with the mystery surrounding him. And as for now, he searches for the right Mercenary company that can make use of his skills, and more specifically fight against the Clans.\n\n <b><color=#e51717>COMMUNITY CONTENT</color></b>",
