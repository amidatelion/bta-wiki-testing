		"Details": "Calvados was settled by the Rim Worlds Republic during the Star League era but was eventually abandoned due to contractions during the Succession Wars. Calvados is a pleasant and comfortable world that was only not a resort world due to its far distance from most heavily populated centers. Still, in the RWR's heyday the high quality of the resorts on Calvados was well known.",
