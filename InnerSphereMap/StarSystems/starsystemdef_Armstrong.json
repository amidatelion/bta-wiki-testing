		"Id": "starsystemdef_Armstrong",
		"Name": "Armstrong",
		"Details": "Armstrong was settled by the Rim Worlds Republic during the Star League era but was eventually abandoned due to contractions during the Succession Wars. Armstrong is actually an inhabited moon of a larger gas giant world, being settled only for its incredible mineral wealth which fueled the industries of the nearby planets for decades. Abandoning the world during the RWR's contraction was a contentious issue, only eventually done as the realities of managing a world so far from Republic lines were too challenging to overcome",
