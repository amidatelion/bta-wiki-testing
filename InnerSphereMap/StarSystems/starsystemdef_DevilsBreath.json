		"Details": "Devil's Breath was settled during the Star League era at some point after the end of the Reunification War but was abandoned by the Outworlds Alliance in the wake of the First Succession War. Still, a small population lingered on Devil's Breath, keeping the planet at subsistence levels for centuries. Additionally, Devil's Breath was known as the ancestral home of the Cerberus Watch, a branch of the Outworlds Alliance's Ground Defense Arm.",
