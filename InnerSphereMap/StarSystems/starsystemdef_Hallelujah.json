		"Details": "Hallelujah is a newly-established colony of Clan Goliath Scorpion, established in order to expand their burgeoning 'empire' by the Seeker Khan, Enrico Kirov. It's not clear why Hallelujah was named as such, though rumors have it that it's named after the statement the original settlers sent by the Seeker Khan uttered upon seeing that the world was a pleasant one as opposed to a miserable rock like Greystone or Fell Wind.",
