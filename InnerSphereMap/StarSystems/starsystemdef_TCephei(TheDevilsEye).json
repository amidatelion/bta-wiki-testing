Located about 690 light-years from Terra, the star is rimward of Tortuga Prime and approximately 100 light-years past Filtvelt. It is a massive Mira variable red giant, so large that its circumference is greater than that of Terra's inner system and would be comparable to that of a full moon from a distance of 1.5 light-years.",
