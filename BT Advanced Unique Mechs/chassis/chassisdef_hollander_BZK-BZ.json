His custom-built designs were popular with a certain kind of clientele but that was just enough to keep the lights on, so when a major mercenary contract rolled through and he had a big payday to spend, Curtiss went all-out on a Solaris mech for himself. He only had so much cash though, so it had to be a light mech and it had to beat other light mechs. Thus, an all-energy Hollander was the ticket, with a Large Variable-Speed Pulse Laser to punish fast movers and twin ER Medium Lasers for all purpose fighting.
