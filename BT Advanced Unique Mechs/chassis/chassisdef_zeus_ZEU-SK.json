One particularly talented Lyran pilot, however, took a very unconventional approach and used his nearly-preternatural piloting skills inside the cockpit of his assigned ZEU-6S. Named 'Skokomish' after his ancestral Native American tribe on Terra, the pilot dubbed Sealth gained incredible respect for his ability to harass the enemy while dodging their return fire, and distracting the opfor from the line of Atlases plodding over the hill. Sealth returned to his home planet after his tour of duty, taking Skokomish with him. It's unknown if this particular mech is the _actual_ Skokomish, but pilots since have invested unknown millions of C-Bills in an attempt to even partially recreate the skill of its original owner.",
