Named the Humble Warlord, Liao described his work on it as \"joyous and humbling\". This Slowpoke is not his original but it bears the same name. If it is meant as a joke or with sincerity, no one can say for sure. This Humble Warlord is built on a 40-rated XL engine with an Endo-Steel frame. It carries thick (for its size) slabs of Hardened Armor, allowing it to bring its FCS-equipped Clan-grade Heavy Medium Laser to bear easily against anyone it encounters.",
