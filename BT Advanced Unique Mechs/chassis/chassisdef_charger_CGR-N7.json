Ford was called the luckiest warrior in the Inner Sphere for his knack of getting into and out of deadly scrapes that would kill other mechs and pilots but that him and Number Seven escaped easily. Unfortunately, his luck eventually failed him and left Number Seven without an owner. Somehow, it looks to have ended up on the arena circuit and been upgraded heavily, now sporting an expanded laser battery and DHS, plus the Jump Jets that led to Ford's end during a botched Death-From-Above.",
