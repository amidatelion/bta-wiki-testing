		"Details": "FrankenMechs are, by definition, slapped together messes. They do not follow normal mech construction rules, they don't even have parts from the same mech most of the time. This irregularity in construction continues deep into the bones of the mech and often ends up with mechs that have unusual hybrid structures because one or more of the parts that make up the FrankenMech had Endo-Steel but the others did not. Hybrid Endo-Steel Standard Structure includes a number of hard-fixed Endo-Steel critical locations that together compose the structure.",
