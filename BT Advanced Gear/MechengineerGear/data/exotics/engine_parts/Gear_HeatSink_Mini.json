		"Details": "This is a Micro Heat Sink. It works on the same basic principles as a standard heat sink does and serves the same basic purpose: to vent waste heat from BattleMech activity. However, the Micro Heat Sink gives up a lot of effectiveness from its heavier brethren and thus is only minorly effective, testing the MechWarrior adage that any heat sinking is better than no heat sinking.",
