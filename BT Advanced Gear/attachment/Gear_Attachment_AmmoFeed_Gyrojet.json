		"Details": "Gyrojets are a relatively new Periphery weapon, developed as an answer to the long-range weaponry of the Inner Sphere, but the Periphery manufacturer Heston, Inc. had trouble solving the ammo feed issue that they suffered from. However, the ever-questing minds of Periphery Arms, Inc. managed to solve that particular challenge with a bulky but functional ammunition feed, geared to accept LRM ammunition. The Gyrojet Ammo Feed still doesn't make Gyrojet particularly durable weapons, but they have more endurance now in combat which has led to a bit of a wider acceptance of the weapon system.",
