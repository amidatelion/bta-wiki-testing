		"Name": "Laser Pulse Module",
		"Details": "Originally theorized by the Star League as a possible enhancement to laser technology, the Laser Pulse Module would not become a reality for centuries, until the New Avalon Institute of Science developed a working version during the Clan Invasion as a possible rapid response option against the Clan technological edge. In brief terms, the Laser Pulse Module essentially turns the attached laser weapon into a pulse version. However, it comes at the cost of the attachment's bulk as well as increasing the heat cost on the weapon by a significant amount. Additionally, the software that the module uses to modulate the laser's emissions is prone to glitches and can freeze up during combat, effectively jamming the weapon for a brief period.",
