		"Details": "This weapon attachment is designed for MG-type weapons, such as Light, Heavy, and Standard Machine Guns, as well as the Sanctuary Gatling Gun, and serves to wire all the MGs in a single location into a collection called an array. This MG Array increases their damage slightly while also increasing each Machine Gun's clustering, meaning the damage groups together much better and increases their ability to punch through thick armor.",
