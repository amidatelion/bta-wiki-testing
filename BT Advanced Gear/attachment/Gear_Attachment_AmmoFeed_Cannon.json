		"Details": "The Light, Medium, and Heavy Cannons found very limited acceptance, even in the Periphery. Being single-use weaponry tarnished their reputation before it even got started. However, some enterprising engineers over at Periphery Arms, Inc. decided to take matters into their own hands and developed an ammo feed system for the Cannons that could accept Rifle ammo, Rifles being chosen because they were essentially cousins to the Cannons. However, there was a problem: the Rifle shells weren't designed for the massive damage Cannons could put out, and so Cannons using this ammo feed did take a hit to their damage potential.",
