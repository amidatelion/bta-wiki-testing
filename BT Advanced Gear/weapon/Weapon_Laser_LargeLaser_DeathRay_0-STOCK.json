		"Details": "The Rim Worlds Republic's manufacturing sector has always been strong. In the wake of the 3050s Clan Invasion that nearly crippled the Republic, President Ivan Helius II ordered the realm's military manufacturers to produce a new crop of weaponry to better defend the realm from further Clan aggression. Included was the so-called 'Death' Ray, a joking name from an engineer on the project that ended up sticking as the real name. This weapon is effectively an overtuned Binary Laser Cannon, multiple Large Laser cores amplified together into a single beam. However, the 'Death' Ray makes incredible waste heat and is also fragile, exploding with force when damaged due to the overcharged components that help produce such large damage output. \n\n <b><color=#099ff2>VOLATILE!</color></b>",
