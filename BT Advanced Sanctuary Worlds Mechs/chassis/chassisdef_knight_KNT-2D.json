One such design was captured and returned to the Sanctuary for study, the Crusader. True to the Sanctuary ethos, the Crusader was broken down and rebuilt as a new design with a Sanctuary twist, the Knight. At 70 tons, the Knight weighs more than its progenitor and serves as a heavy battle design. The Knight is built on a 280-rated Sanctuary XL engine and Endo-Steel frame. It is armed with two each VRM-18s, DRM-6s, and Twin-Linked Small Lasers. Four jump jets and 15 DHS keep it fully functional in any combat situation.",
