With that in mind, several Dane Sacellum engineers set out to make a more durable Dervish and they succeeded. Using a rock-solid Dense Engine and using SHIELD for both of the mech's ammo bins, they managed to make a tank from the Dervish. However, the weapons had to be weakened, dropping to a trio of Medium Modal Lasers, a pair of APM-4s with 4 total tons of ammo, and a Small Electro-Laser. Still, the -10A was quite popular and saw many production runs.",
