One such design was captured and returned to the Sanctuary for study, the Crusader. True to the Sanctuary ethos, the Crusader was broken down and rebuilt as a new design with a Sanctuary twist, the Knight. At 70 tons, the Knight weighs more than its progenitor and serves as a heavy battle design. The KNT-3G is built on a 280-rated Sanctuary XL engine and Endo-Steel frame with a Sanctuary Supercharger for extra mobility. It uses this weight and speed to bring twin Gamma Cannons to bear against its enemies, aided by an excellent targeting computer for increased accuracy. Two Medium Electro-Lasers are the sole concession to closer-ranged combat.",
