However, due to the machinations of [[DM.Factions[faction_ComStar],ComStar]] and the recovery of missing heirs of the Cameron family, the Hegemony was reborn in teh 3030s, much to the chagrin of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSuccessorState],Successor States]]. The Hegemony has rapidly regained much of its ancestral strength as world after world quickly clamored to rejoin the nation and recover as much of their ancestral glories as possible. Today, the Hegemony is poised to reclaim their place as the premier nation in the Inner Sphere.",
