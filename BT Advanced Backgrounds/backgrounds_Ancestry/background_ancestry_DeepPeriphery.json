Little is known about these regions, but they are far from uninhabited. The Deep Periphery is littered with abandoned colonies and small outposts, isolated from the rest of humanity. After the fall of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreStarLeague],Star League]], General [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKerensky],Aleksandr Kerensky]] led the remnants of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSLDF],Star League Defense Force]] into the Deep Periphery, disappearing from the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreInnerSphere],Inner Sphere]] and from recorded history.",
