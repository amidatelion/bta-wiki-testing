	"Name": "Bounty Hunter",
	"Details": "Bounty hunters were individuals who could be hired to capture or kill a designated target. The target would have a price or bounty on their heads that would be collected by the bounty hunter upon successful capture or proof of death. Bounty hunters would sometimes team together as part of a larger mission or to handle dangerous targets.\r\n\r\nThere have been several sightings of 'The Bounty Hunter' over the past centuries, wearing a suit to obscure their identity enough to allow this mysterious figure to remain unidentified by both employers and his targets, except by persona and reputation.\r\n\r\nPASSIVE: The Commander gains a very slight Called Shot bonus (roughly 5%).",
