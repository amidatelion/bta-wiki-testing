	"Name": "Special Operative",
	"Details": "Special operations are activities conducted by specially designated, organized, selected, trained, and equipped forces using unconventional techniques and modes of employment. Colloquially the word spy is thrown around, and when caught red-handed many an operative has been executed for espionage and treason.\r\n\r\nSome operatives were non-combatants who used stealth or subterfuge to infiltrate a target and retrieve or contaminate information for a faction. Others were specialized combat troops emerging from stealth to ambush and eliminate enemies in close-range combat. Finally, talented sharpshooters that use long range rifles to recon and eliminate targets in a civilian or military setting were not unheard of. Combining the expertise of multiple disciplines, operatives adapt to any environment and any circumstance to ensure their agenda is achieved.\r\n\r\nPASSIVE: The Commander gains +2 better accuracy at maximum range.",
