	"Details": "Offroad racing, or rallying, is a form of motorsports consisting of specially modified vehicles (including cars, trucks, motorbikes, buggies and even mechs) racing on unsurfaced roads, cross country or even obstacle courses. Brackets exist for all types of distances, weight classes, and on the more exotic courses, even weaponry.\r\n\r\nPartly due to the performance capabilities of modern racing vehicles and exposure to extremely large g-forces, racing drivers require a high level of fitness, focus and the ability to concentrate at high levels for long periods in an inherently difficult environment.\r\n\r\nRacing drivers at the highest levels are usually paid by a team, or by sponsors, and can command substantial salaries until their performance begins to decline.\r\n\r\nPASSIVE: The Commander gets +30 to their unsteady threshold in any mech they pilot.",
