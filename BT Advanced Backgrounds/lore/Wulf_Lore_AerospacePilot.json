	"Details": "Aerospace Fighters are similar to conventional aircraft, but are capable of operating in both an atmosphere and in space, which makes them far more versatile. Aerospace fighters utilized much of the same technology as BattleMechs, such as using thin strands of myomer to control flight surfaces.\r\n\r\nPilots wear neurohelmets which use their kinesthetic sense to help perform maneuvers and view their environment through a holographic head's-up display. Unlike the HUD of its terrestrial-bound cousins, aerospace fighter HUDs are bowl-shaped to account for the three-dimensional battlefield, with the center of the bowl aligned with the nose of the craft.\r\n\r\nPASSIVE: The Commander gains a 5% sprint speed bonus.",
