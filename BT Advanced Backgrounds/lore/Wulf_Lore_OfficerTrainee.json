	"Details": "More than a hundred renowned Military Academies populate the Inner Sphere, and many times more their unnamed equivalents throughout the Galaxy. Whatever a student's background when they arrive, they'll all have one thing in common: to even make it into an Academy program means you're sporting a natural talent for combat.\r\n\r\nSome trainees fail to make it through their schooling, or end up working as freelancers instead of in the traditional military. Whether they end up with a diploma or not, all Officer Trainees were exposed to the most rigorous mental and physical training, to develop the skills and confidence needed to lead the men and women that make up any Armed Forces.\r\n\r\nPASSIVE: The Commander gains +2 resolve whenever resolve is gained.",
