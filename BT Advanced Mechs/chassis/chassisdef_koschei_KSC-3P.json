		"Details": "The Koschei-3P is a rarer periphery design sometimes seen in more decorated forces. After obtaining ancient Koschei-3I's through discovery of sealed caches there was a dilemma. The original design, while fast for It's weight, was a product of a much simpler time, and its age was showing. Despite that, it was a heavy mech, and those are premium commodities all the way out here, so it was decided that some elbow grease and a few extra C-bills could be spared. The Koschei-3P's biggest, and most expensive difference is the removal of It's standard engine for a prototype XL. The armor plating was also changed to Heavy Plating Armor, giving a notable increase in armor protection. The weaponry was removed in favor of an ammo feed modified Heavy Cannon with three tons of ammo while the lasers were replaced with a pair of Medium Binary Lasers, and backup Small Lasers.",
