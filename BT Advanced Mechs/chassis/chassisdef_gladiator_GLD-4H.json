The old Gladiator's Primitive Engine was quickly discarded for a Fuel Cell, which saved on cost compared to a proper Fusion Engine. Taking advantage of the Fuel Cell's excess heat sinking the Marian techs almost completely redesigned the housing of the right arm so that a second Large Laser Core could be linked to the one already present creating a L Binary Laser. The shoulder was also almost entirely hollowed out so that 40 rocket tubes fed by an 80 round bin could be installed behind a false panel in order to catch enemy Mechwarriors by surprise. The Twin Medium Lasers from the original design were retained.",
