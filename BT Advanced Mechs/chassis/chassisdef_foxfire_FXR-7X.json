During the 3060s when the Lyran Commonwealth was revitalizing the Foxfire, they performed several experimental upgrades designed to test the limits on what an ultralight was capable of. One such design was the FXR-7X, built around a unique weapon, the Furyflame Cannon. This miniaturized artillery piece had the FXR-7X built around it, all other considerations were secondary, including cost. The -7X uses an XL engine along with a Small Cockpit, Endo-Steel bones, and Ferro-Fibrous plating to get the artillery piece equipped. For backup firepower the -7X has a quartet of Medium Lasers.",
