Due to technological constraints its ferro has been replaced with retro light and  its endo is downgraded to proto endo, however it has gained a proto-xl engine. Designed to slaughter infantry, tanks and fortified locations its has 40 ammo fed inferno rocket tubes in the left arm and two back up flamers in the right. While lacking mech to mech combat power it excels in its role as a terror mech making it very feared by the Marians' periphery enemies who have dubbed it the Hell Bunny.",
