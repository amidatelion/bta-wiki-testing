Armed with a grab-bag of lasers and support weapons, the Disrupter was designed to flank an enemy in any terrain and make their lives miserable. Powered by a 210-rated XL engine and clad in 6.5 tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor, the Disrupter was durable and mobile thanks to its five jump jets. The DSR-6V is a dedicated fire support design, carrying an Improved LRM-20 for firepower. A sole Medium Pulse Laser is the only concession to close-range combat. Finally, a Guardian ECM keeps the 'Mech protected electronically.",
