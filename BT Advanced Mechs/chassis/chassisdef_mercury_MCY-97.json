However, examples survived in ComStar's armies and would be put back into production by both ComStar and the reborn Terran Hegemony in the 3050s. The MCY-97 is a refreshed ComStar variant put into production for the Battle of Tukayyid and intended exclusively for recon. To that end, it has a 160-rated engine as well as a MASC for extra speed. To improve its recon capabilities, it carries a Beagle Active Probe. For firepower, it has a simple Medium and Small Laser combo.",
