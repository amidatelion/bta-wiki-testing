The Junior, being among the first ultralights, was quickly outpaced by other later designs. It is slow by ultralight standards but at least is well-armed and armored for its weight class. Armed with a Medium Laser and twin Small lasers and clad in two tons of armor, the Junior can easily win a fight against other ultralight units. House Davion has kept the Junior in off-and-on production for centuries and it is currently being produced once again.",
