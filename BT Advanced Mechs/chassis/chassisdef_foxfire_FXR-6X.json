During the 3060s when the Lyran Commonwealth was revitalizing the Foxfire, they performed several experimental upgrades designed to test the limits on what an ultralight was capable of. One such design was the FXR-6X, built around mammoth 210-rated XXL fusion engine, giving the Foxfire a ground speed of over 200 kph at full sprint. Unfortunately, the gigantic engine precludes the use of any serious weaponry and the FXR-6X mounts only the Firestorm as well as two standard Flamers. The brass considered the FXR-6X a failure and production quickly ceased after a brief test run.",
