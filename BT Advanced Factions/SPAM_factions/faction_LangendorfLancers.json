	"Description": "The Langendorf Lancers were formed by merchant cartels on the planet of Calloway VI for mutual defense, but were eventually transferred to the Free Worlds League as a traditional mercenary command when they proved too troublesome for the merchants to handle. However, in 3058 the Capellan Confederation bought out their contract and so the Lancers changed affiliation.",
