	"Description": "The Abominari are an unusual pirate warband with an unclear provenance. They appeared in the Magistracy of Canopus without any warning, broadcasting nonsensical mashed-up biblical scriptures, and attacking without pause. Their equipment is in decent repair and they offer no explanation of their actions. Indeed, they simply appear, raid or kill their targets, and vanish as quickly as they came.",
