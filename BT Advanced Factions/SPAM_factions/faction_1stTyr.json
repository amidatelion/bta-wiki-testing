	"Description": "The 1st Tyr is unique among the KungsArme in that it existed as a fighting force since before the Free Rasalhague Republic was founded. The 1st Tyr was made with Lyran help for the Fourth Succession War and was kept hidden, an entire regiment of BattleMechs, until it was needed again during the Ronin Wars when it helped establish the FRR proper. It was then deactivated once more, until recently when it was resurrected to serve the FRR again.",
