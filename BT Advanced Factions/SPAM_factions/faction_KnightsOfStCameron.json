	"Description": "Once a laughingstock of the mercenary circuit, the Knights Of St. Cameron have been reborn in the last 10 years. Thought destroyed by Clan Wolf, the Knights returned from corners unknown with heavily laden DropShips and took up their traditional call for MechWarriors descended from the original SLDF to join them. Now, the Knights are a highly skilled and dedicated combat force, not to be trifled with.",
