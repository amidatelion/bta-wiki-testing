	"Description": "The Magistracy Cavaliers have their origins deep in Canopian history, with Cassandra's Volunteers, the original national guard of the early Magistracy. Later, after being stationed on the planet Thraxa for decades, the third battalion of the Volunteers, Clayborne's Commandos, effectively detached from the MAF at large to serve Thraxan interests instead. In 3057, the MAF noticed this and brokered a deal to reabsorb the Commandos with the caveat that at least one battalion of them would remain on planet at all times and so the Cavaliers were born from that deal.",
