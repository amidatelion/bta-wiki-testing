	"Description": "Santander's Killers are a pirate band originally founded by Helmar Valasek, though Valasek is believed to be dead. In fact, the Killers were presumed destroyed by Clan Smoke Jaguar during the Clan Invasion in 3049 on Santander V. However, it seems that the Killers somehow survived and escaped to the Outworlds Wastes from which they plague the Alliance.",
