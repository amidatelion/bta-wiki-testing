	"Description": "The Fighting Urukhai are a venerable mercenary unit that has served with the Federated Suns for most of its history. Formed from a number of minor Star League Defense Force units that refused to join Kerensky's Exodus, the Fighting Urukhai have a pockmarked reputation, one that finally pushed them out of Federated Suns service after one too many public incidents. Still, their combat skills can't be denied.",
