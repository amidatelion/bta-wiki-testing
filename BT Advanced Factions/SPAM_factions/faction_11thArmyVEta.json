	"Description": "The 11th Army V-Eta, originally stationed in Lyran space, has suffered Lyran pettiness and spite for nearly seven years at this point, with the LCAF directly and indirectly interfering with the 11th Army's operations whenever possible. Despite this petty behavior though, the 11th remains a potent fighting force, well the match for any who test their mettle.",
