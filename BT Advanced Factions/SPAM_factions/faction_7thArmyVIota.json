	"Description": "The 7th Army V-Iota is an army under siege, though not from external foes. Instead, the 7th Army has been hard hit from internal fractures and frictions for years now. First the Word of Blake schism tore much of the heart out of the army and then various internal conflicts and unit and personnel transfers have badly affected the army's functionality. Still, it struggles onwards, and even with all the troubles remains an effective fighting force, though not the best the ComGuard have to offer.",
