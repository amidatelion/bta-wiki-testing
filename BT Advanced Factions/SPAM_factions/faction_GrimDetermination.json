	"Description": "Grim Determination is a dedicated mercenary unit with an extensive history, dating back to the Amaris Civil War. Long employed by the Federated Suns, the unit was stationed on Sarna in 3057 during Operation Guerrero. However, when Sarna declared itself an independent state, the Sarna Supremacy, the unit was unsure how to react and instead waited for future orders. However, the Suns betrayed the unit and claimed they broke their contract. Bereft of other options, Grim Determination signed on with the Supremacy and remained in the Chaos March.",
