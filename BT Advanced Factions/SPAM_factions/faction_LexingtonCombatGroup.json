	"Description": "The Lexington Combat Group was formed from SLDF troops who declined to join Kerensky's Exodus and instead stayed behind to form a mercenary command. They have served several masters but are best known for their service to House Davion over the course of the Succession Wars. However, realizing they were slowly being trapped into a company store situation, the Lexington Combat Group received an offer from the newly-reformed Terran Hegemony to enter their service and escape their mounting debts, an offer the mercenary unit took with gusto.",
