	"Description": "The Word of Blake's forces are divided into two main commands: the primary and high quality forces and the Protectorate Militia. The Militia is equipped with less good technology than the main WoB military and is often the first line of defense for the Word's holdings. However, the Militia is just as dedicated to the Word's cause as the mainline forces and fights with the same zeal.",
