	"Description": "The 10th Lyran Guards are incredibly critical of the sitting Archon of the Lyran Commonwealth, Katherine Steiner, claiming she is a pretender to the throne. Because the 10th backs First Prince Victor Steiner-Davion in his bid to heal the divisions of the realm they have been blacklisted by Katherine, a situation which only encourages the unit's loyalty to the First Prince.",
