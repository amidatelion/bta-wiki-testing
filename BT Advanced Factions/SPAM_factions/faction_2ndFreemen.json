	"Description": "The 2nd Freemen have faced the Clans several times, specifically Clan Wolf. After being outwitted on Hainfeld and after heavy fighting on Carse, the Freemen were forced back to Ueda, where thanks to the Truce of Tukayyid the Wolves never pursued them. Today, after heavy investment from Elected-Prince Magnusson, the 2nd Freemen are the largest military formation in the KungsArme and are ready to take the fight to anyone who would threaten the FRR, especially the Clans.",
