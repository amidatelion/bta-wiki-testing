	"Description": "The Blue Star of Kerensky was a medal given to 37 members of the SLDF in the wake of the Amaris Civil War. When Kerensky issued his call for the Exodus, every recipient of the Blue Star stayed behind. Together, they formed a mercenary command, the Blue Star Irregulars, and chose the most noble of available masters to serve, House Davion, whom they have served for nearly 300 years since.",
