	"Description": "The 5th Donegal Guards were shattered during the Third Succession Wars and languished for decades as a second-rate unit. However, with Katherine Steiner taking the throne of the Lyran Commonwealth and given the 5ths staunch loyalty to her the unit has been swiftly rebuilt and trained up to be a skilled fighting force. Today, the 5th Donegal Guards are a powerful unit in service to the Lyran throne.",
