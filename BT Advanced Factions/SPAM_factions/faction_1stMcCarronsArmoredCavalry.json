	"Description": "McCarron's Armored Cavalry, colloquially called the Big MAC, is one of the most famous mercenary units in existence. Or, at least they were, before they signed on with the Capellan Confederation as a full-fledged House unit. Today, the Big MAC continues much as it has in the past, only this time with the full backing of the Confederation. If the Big MAC shows up to your battlefield, it's time to leave.",
