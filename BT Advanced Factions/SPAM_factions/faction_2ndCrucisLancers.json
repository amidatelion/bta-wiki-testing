	"Description": "The 2nd Crucis Lancers owe their fealty and prosperity to the Davion family, much as other Crucis Lancer formations do. However, after being badly mauled during the Succession Wars, the 2nd was deactivated for a time in order to rebuild. Now rebuilt, the 2nd stands ready to repay House Davion's faith in them by winning victories over House Davion's foes.",
