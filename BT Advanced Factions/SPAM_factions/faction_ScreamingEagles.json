	"Description": "The Screaming Eagles have been dogged by controversy and bad luck for years now. Originally founded by SLDF members in the wake of the Star League's fall and finding themselves in service to the Davions for centuries, the Screaming Eagles left Davion service only to be betrayed and have their reputation crippled by their new employer's duplicity. Today, they're back in Davion service as the only House willing to work with them again.",
