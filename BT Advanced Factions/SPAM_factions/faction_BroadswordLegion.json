	"Description": "The Broadsword Legion is a recently created mercenary unit composed of ex-ComGuard officers and soldiers who chose to resign rather than serve under Victor Steiner-Davion upon his nomination as Precentor Martial of ComStar. Most of the Broadsword Legion's members were formally of the ComGuard's 166th Division and fought against Clan Wolf during the Battle of Tukayyid, giving them a keen insight into the Clan threat.",
