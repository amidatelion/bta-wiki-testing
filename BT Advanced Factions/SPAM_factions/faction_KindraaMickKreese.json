		"Freeborn, you have been very consistent in your hatred of the Fire Mandrill Clan.  If my own kindraa were available I would use them for this task, but as they are occupied with more worthy opponents, you can take this batchall, or not.",
		"My kindraa have faced you in battle before Freeborn, and several lie dead by your hand.  Perhaps you can spill someone elses blood for a change with this batchall?",
		"Freeborn, I have heard from other kindraa you have battled before that you are a competent warrior.  Perhaps you can assist me in this small task?",
		"Freeborn, you are an unknown to us.  Prove yourself on the field of battle with this batchall, and we may have further use of you.",
		"Freeborn, you have assisted other kindraa of the Fire Mandrill in the past, and I would like to offer you this batchall so that you can assist my kindraa as well.",

		"Greetings my trusted friend.  You have helped me so often, I almost look at you as a member of my own kindraa.  I have this choice batchall for you, if you are interested?"

	"Description": "Clan Fire Mandrill is divided into various sub-groups called Kindraa, of which Kindraa Mick-Kreese is a lesser specimen. Mick-Kreese has long struggled for resources and had to scrape and claw for everything it has, leading to the Kindraa often regarding other Kindraa with contempt and bitterness. Still, they are Clan warriors and thus are a force to be feared in the Inner Sphere.",
