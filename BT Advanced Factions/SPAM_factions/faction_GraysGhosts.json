The Ghosts are notorious for their escapades, involving sexual violence on civilians, drug abuse issues, and war crimes, to the point that some consider the Ghosts to be mere bandits masquerading as mercenaries. However, the Ghosts are known to be very successful at crowd control and counterinsurgency operations, ensuring they have steady employment.",
