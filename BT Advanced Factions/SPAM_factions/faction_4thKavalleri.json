	"Description": "The 4th Kavalleri has never faced the Clans, a fact that defines the unit's reputation. Considered weak and unready by the rest of the KungsArme, the 4th Kavalleri unfortunately agrees and morale remains low, despite Overbefalhavare Mansdotter's efforts to bolster the unit. For now, they remain a garrison unit until such time as their fortunes change and they begin to believe in themselves.",
