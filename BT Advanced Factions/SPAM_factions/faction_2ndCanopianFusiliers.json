	"Description": "Known for their virulent hatred of the Star League (which has extended to the newly formed Second Star League), the 2nd Canopian Fusiliers have a distinguished record dating back to the Amaris Civil War, where they savaged the Star League's divisions that came to put down the rebellious Periphery. Today, they are known for their excellent combat rating and their hate of the Second Star League, though they were passed over for joining the St. Ives-Capellan War.",
