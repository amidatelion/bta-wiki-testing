	"Description": "The Aurigan Reach has had to deal with its share of piracy over the years, much of it led by the Queen of Axylus, Grim Sybil. However, after her demise, one of her lieutenants named Silas \"Hookworm\" Black formed a new band and traveled to the Free Worlds League for richer hunting grounds. Hookworm's Highwaymen is a small but ferocious pirate band and is not to be underestimated.",
