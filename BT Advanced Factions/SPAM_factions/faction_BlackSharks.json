	"Description": "The Black Sharks are an old mercenary unit, dating back to the First Succession War where the Thirteenth Republic Light Lancers deserted from Stefan Amaris's forces in protest of his atrocities and formed the Black Sharks. After over a century of floating between various Great Houses during the Succession Wars, the Sharks finally came home to the Rim Worlds Republic in the 2900s, where they have remained employed ever since.",
