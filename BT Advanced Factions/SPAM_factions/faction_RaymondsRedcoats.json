	"Description": "Raymond's Redcoats is a unit with a shadowy history. Originally claiming to be descended from a lost SLDF division, the truth came out in 2836 after 30 years in House Steiner service: Raymond's Redcoats actually descended from a shattered Rim Worlds Republic regiment that had to turn to piracy for decades just to survive, only to reform their image and go legit when Irwin Raymond took over the unit in 2803. Today, the unit's history is mostly a fun footnote placed after their excellent combat performance, though the unit does still prefer bounty and pirate hunting contracts.",
