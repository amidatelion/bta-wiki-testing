	"Description": "Johann's Jaegers is a mercenary unit descended from the venerable 10th Lyran Guard. After serving with the 10th Lyran during Operation Bulldog and traveling to Huntress to rescue Task Force Serpent, Hauptmann Johann von Heidelberg retired from the LCAF along with several of his core officers and formed Johann's Jaegers, a small and elite cavalry command with a specialty in taking the most difficult contracts and succeeding where others failed. The Jaegers have declared in support of Victor Steiner-Davion and are expected to support the rightful First Prince in his efforts to dethrone his sister.",
