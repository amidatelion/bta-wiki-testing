	"Description": "A command with a troubled past, Simonson's Cutthroats has only recently reappeared. In 3055, after a distastrous engagement with a pirate force, the Cutthroats vanished into the Deep Periphery, presumably never to be seen again. However, in 3061 the Cutthroats reappeared in the Chaos March and signed a contract with the Word of Blake.",
