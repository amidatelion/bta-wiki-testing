	"Description": "The 15th Lyran Regulars are a standard Lyran line regiment with a long and distinguished history as a defensive force. However, during Operation Bulldog, the destruction of Clan Smoke Jaguar, the 15th Regulars were tasked with engaging Omega Galaxy. After an extended game of cat-and-mouse, the 15th lifted off, having distracted Omega Galaxy long enough for other units to achieve their objectives.",
