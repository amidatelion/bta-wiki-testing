	"Description": "The Cohors Morituri, or the Cohort of the Dead, is a Marian Hegemony military formation officially formed from men too dangerous to allow out of the Hegemony's control, such as cashiered soldiers or officers too well-connected to release. Unofficially, it is a punishment assignment for those men who are enemies of the Caesar or his generals. The Cohors Morituri is undersupplied, understaffed, and unsupported, but somehow gets it done every time anyways.",
