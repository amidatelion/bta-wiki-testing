	"Description": "Bronson's Horde began after its commander, William Bronson, was ejected from the Eridani Light Horse for losing touch with the ELH's proud traditions. Bronson carried a vendetta against the ELH ever since, one he passed to his son and that poisoned the unit into making a surprise attack against the ELH, costing them much of their manpower and reputation. Effectively exiled to the Periphery, Bronson's Horde is a shadow of what it once was and still bears a terrible grudge against the Light Horse.",
