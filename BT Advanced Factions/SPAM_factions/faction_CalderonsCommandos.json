	"Description": "After the death of Jeffrey Calderon and the assumption of leadership by Grover Shraplen, some in the Concordat protested this. Among them was Stewart Bogdanovich-Calderon, a distant member of the Calderon family tree, who decreed that a Calderon would rule the Concordat even if they had to take it by force. To that end, Bogdanovich-Calderon set about creating Calderon's Commandos and waging a one-man war against the Concordat.",
