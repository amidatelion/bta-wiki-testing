	"Description": "The 40th Shadow Division is a complete mystery. Who they are, where they come from, or what their aims are is completely unknown. They do not respond to comms and do not offer any of their own. They simply fight, kill, and die for the Word of Blake. They are highly elite warriors and are equipped with seemingly the best technologies that the Blakists can muster. Beyond that, nothing is known about the force.",
