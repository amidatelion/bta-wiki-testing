	"Description": "The Word of Blake is a splinter faction of ComStar that was created out of a conservative backlash against the removal of ComStar's mystical and religious aspects. The Word of Blake moved first to the Free Worlds League, taking ownership of the FWL'S HPG system and later conquered Terra from ComStar, establishing a small Protectorate around Terra.",
