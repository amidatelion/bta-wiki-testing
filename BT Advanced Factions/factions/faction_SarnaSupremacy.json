	"Description": "The Sarna Supremacy was originally an interstellar state in the days before the Star League and even before the Great Houses themselves formed and it originally helped found the Capellan Confederation. After being a part of the Capellan Confederation for centuries, Sarna, Kaifeng, and Sakhalin once again declared independence and the Sarna Supremacy was reborn as part of the Chaos March."
