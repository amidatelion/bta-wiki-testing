	"Description": "The result of a schism in Clan Wolf during the Refusal War, Clan Wolf-in-Exile moved totally to the Inner Sphere under the leadership of Khan Phelan Kell and took up residence on Arc-Royal with the permission of the Kell Hounds, whom they shared the world with due to Phelan Kell's history with the unit. Clan Wolf-in-Exile maintained the ways of the Wolves but with a strong Warden bent to defend the Inner Sphere from the Clans while the main Clan Wolf took a Crusader stance and resumed aggressive postures against the Inner Sphere.",
