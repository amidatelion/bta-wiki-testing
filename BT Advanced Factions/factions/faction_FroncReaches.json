		"Hello again, Commander. You need money, we need work done, take a look at this contract.",
		"The Fronc Reaches has need of a good mercenary company and you come recommended. Ready to do some business, Commander?",

	"Description": "Originally called the New Colony Region, the Fronc Reaches were settled by a joint effort between the Taurian Concordat and the Magistracy of Canopus and declared independence for themselves in 3066. Led by President Carver Trondel from the world of Fronc, the Fronc Reaches are staunchly independent and protectionist, wanting to be left alone to pursue their own agenda in peace."
