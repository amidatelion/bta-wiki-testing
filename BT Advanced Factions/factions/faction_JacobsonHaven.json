		"I don't know much about you, but word is that you're good. Prove me right with this contract.",

	"Description": "One of the original powers in the Sanctuary Worlds, the Jacobson Haven was originally a representative democracy but very quickly that turned into a veneer only as crime families took over and formed shadowy syndicates that really run the state. It possesses no unified military, instead each prominent family provides soldiers for any given military effort. The families spend as much time fighting each other as they do the other Sanctuary Worlds powers, but given their immense personal wealth and formidable militias, the Haven has endured. Havenfolk, as they're known, enjoy only as much freedom as they can buy which, while bad for the commonfolk, is excellent for soldiers of fortune and mercenaries."
