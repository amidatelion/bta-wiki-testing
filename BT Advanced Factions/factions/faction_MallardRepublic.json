		"I've got work for you again. Get the job done, merc, and I'll be sure the Senate releases your pay on time.",
		"You've been somewhat reliable in the past, I hope you're the right one for this job, prove me right to trust you.",
		"Even though the Senate is gridlocked again, I've still got work to be done. The pay is favorable and I suspect you can handle it with ease.",
		"Commander, glad to see you again. The Armed Forces Oversight Committee just passed me this request, I think you're the man for the job for us.",

	"Description": "One of the original powers in the Sanctuary Worlds, the Mallard Republic was based on the old Terran republics of pre-spaceflight history. Governed by an elected body of the people called the Mallard Senate, the Republic has proven itself slow to act and burdened with bureaucracy. The army of the Republic, the Mallard Republic Armed Forces, is similarly clunky but is buoyed by the Republic's cutting-edge science and technology development programs which have kept the Republic competitive with its rivals for centuries. Additionally, the high quality of life and many freedoms in the Republic keep its people satisfied even with the bureaucracy weighing things down."
