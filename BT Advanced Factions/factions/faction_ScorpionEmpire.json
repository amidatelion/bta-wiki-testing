		"Freeborn, you are an unknown to us. Prove yourself on the field of battle with this batchall and we may have further use of you.",
		"Freeborn, you have assisted the Goliath Scorpions in the past, and so I will offer you this batchall so that we can continue this relationship.",
		"Hello again, friend to the Goliath Scorpions. While there is certainly trust between us, I would like you to take this batchall to show your sincerity before we share all our secrets with you.",
		"Greetings friend. You have proven your value to the Goliath Scorpions many times. I have a task I would entrust to no other, and perhaps afterwards we shall share some necrosa?"

	"Description": "After their conquest of both Nueva Castile and the Hanseatic League, Clan Goliath Scorpion founded the Scorpion Empire. This empire has established itself as the preeminent Deep Periphery power and is slowly synthesizing the strengths of the Clan with those of their conquered territories. Though this process is not without teething issues it shows excellent promise for the future.",
