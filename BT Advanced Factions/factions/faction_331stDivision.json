	"Description": "The 331st Royal BattleMech Division was a division of the Star League Defense Force and disappeared from known space with Aleksandr Kerensky during the Exodus. Presumably they became a Clan, and yet, here they are once more. They give away nothing about their origins, leaving their identity a mystery.",
