		"Commander, you have fought the Legions before, and acquitted yourself well.  Rather than face the might of the Hegemony again, perhaps you would prefer to take up this task?",
		"Greetings Commander.  Our Legions are occupied at the moment, and as a result I have a task you can perform in the name of Caesar.",
		"Hello again Commander.  Caesar appreciates your past assistance, and I am authorized to offer you another contract.",
		"Hail Commander.  You have proved quite useful to the Marian Hegemony, and I have saved this contract as reward for your services.",
		"Hail Commander.  If all our Legions were as effective as you, we would have an empire to match any of the Successor Houses.  I have this contract that I would entrust to no other, for your consideration."
