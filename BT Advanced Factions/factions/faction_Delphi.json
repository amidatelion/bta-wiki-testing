		"Commander, your constant desire to take up contracts against our poor nearly defenseless worlds is going to end up with the genocide of our society!  Please help us with this small task, and save our children from slavery.",

		"Commander, if you have been attacking the planets of the New Delphi Compact for money, we can offer you similar contracts that will preserve our independence, and I beg you to consider this one.",
		"Welcome to the New Delphi Compact, Commander.  I have a task for you to undertake, if you would like to help preserve our independence.  You will of course be adequately compensated for your efforts.",
