	"Description": "One of the original powers in the Sanctuary Worlds, the Dane Sacellum was patterned off of an ancient Terran religion and is deeply spiritual as a whole. The ruler of the Sacellum is known as the High Lord and is advised by the Conclave, a group of elected religious officials who help manage the Sacellum in general. Day-to-day management typically falls to religious community leaders who advise individual Daners on their actions. The Sacellum's military is known as the Dane Phalanx and is highly regimented and organized."
