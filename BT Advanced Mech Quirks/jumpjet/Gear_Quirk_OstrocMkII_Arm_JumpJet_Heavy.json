		"Details": "In the late 2800s, Ostmann Industries set out to revolutionize the BattleMech industry, once and for all. They took one of their seminal designs, the versatile and powerful Ostroc, and gave it something unique, something to change the Inner Sphere: arm-mounted jump jets. Ostmann's engineers managed to develop shoulder pack mounted jump jets that could be mounted to a chassis and gave significantly more lift than normal jump jets. However, the shoulder jump jets had to be hard-wired into the frame of the mech and were a nightmare to maintain, due to their experimental status. Additionally, due to technical limitaions they had to carry internal fuel instead of linking into the 'Mech's fusion reaction and so they were highly explosive and rather bulky. Ostmann's Ostroc Mk.II did not sell particularly well, despite the technical wonder they had achieved, and Ostmann Industries quietly shelved the design, though some Mk.II's can still be found in the wild.",
